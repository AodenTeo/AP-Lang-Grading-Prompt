### Row A â€” Thesis (0â€“1 points):

* **0 points**: Thesis merely restates the prompt, provides only summary without a claim, or does not directly respond to the prompt.
* **1 point**: Presents a defensible thesis clearly responding to the prompt with a specific claim about the rhetorical choices the writer makes.
Responses that earn one point tend to be of the form: [Author] uses [Rhetorical devices] to achieve [aim]. Any version or paraphrasing of this counts as a thesis. 

### Row B â€“ Evidence & Commentary (0â€“4 points)

#### ðŸŸ¢ Evidence Clarification:

* **Specific Evidence**: Clearly quotes or explicitly and accurately references specific details/moments directly from the passage to support claims. These quotes must be woven into the argument, rather than randomly dropped in. 
* **General Evidence**: Vague references to the text or broad summaries without pinpointing specific textual details.

#### ðŸŸ¢ Mandatory Evidence Threshold:

* An essay must include at least **one specific, clearly quoted or detailed piece of evidence** with some attempt at commentary to score **2 or more points**.

| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **0 pts** | No evidence beyond restating thesis, or evidence is irrelevant to the prompt/thesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **1 pt** | Provides mostly general evidence with little to no specific quoting or paraphrasing. Commentary is minimal, absent, or merely summarizes the evidence without explaining its rhetorical function or connection to the thesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **2 pts** | Provides at least **one piece of specific evidence** (e.g., a direct quote or clear paraphrase of a specific moment). Commentary attempts to explain how this evidence relates to the argument, but may be simplistic, limited, or not fully developed for other pieces of evidence. The essay might rely on some general evidence as well.                                                                                                                                          |
| **3 pts** | Provides **multiple pieces of specific evidence** from the passage, which are woven into the argument naturally, as opposed to awkwardly dropped in. Commentary explains how at least one or two pieces of evidence support a claim or line of reasoning with clear explanation of rhetorical function. However, other pieces of evidence may have commentary that is more descriptive, less developed, or doesn't fully explain the rhetorical function (how the choice works or its effect) in relation to the thesis. The analysis shows understanding but isn't consistently developed across all key evidence. |
| **4 pts** (**CRITICAL - Read Carefully**) | Provides **multiple distinct pieces of specific evidence** (typically 3 or more that support main analytical points). For **ALL** these key pieces of evidence, the commentary **explains their rhetorical function**â€”that is, *how* the author uses the choice and/or *what effect* it has in relation to the student's thesis or specific claims about the author's rhetoric. The commentary must be purposeful and go beyond summary for each key piece of evidence. **Slight variations in the depth of these explanations are acceptable, but an explanation of rhetorical function must be present for each key piece of evidence. The student consistently attempts to explain *why* the author made these choices or *what their impact is*.** |

#### ðŸŸ¢ CRITICAL GUIDANCE for Scoring Row B (Evidence & Commentary):

* **Achieving 4 Points - The Standard**: To earn 4 points, the student must establish and maintain a pattern for their main analytical points:
    1.  Identify a specific rhetorical choice.
    2.  Provide specific textual evidence for that choice.
    3.  Explain the **rhetorical function** of that choice/evidence â€“ specifically, *how* it works or *what effect* it is intended to achieve in relation to the author's argument/purpose or the student's thesis.
    This pattern must be evident for **multiple (at least 2) key pieces of evidence/analytical points.**
* **"Consistently Explains Rhetorical Function" for 4 Points - Interpretation is Key**:
    * This means that for *each* of the main pieces of evidence the student uses to build their argument, commentary is present and explicitly explains its rhetorical purpose or effect.
* **Distinguishing 3 from 4 Points - Focus on Completeness of Functional Commentary**:
    * A '4' provides an explanation of rhetorical function for *all* its key evidence.
    * A '3' might provide multiple pieces of evidence but offer strong functional commentary for only some, while for others, the commentary might be more summary or missing the "how/why it's persuasive" link. **If the student attempts to explain the rhetorical function for all key pieces of evidence supporting distinct claims, and these explanations are plausible (even if some are more concise or basic than others), award 4 points.** Only if one or more key pieces of evidence lacks an explanation should a 3 be considered.
* **Conciseness, typos, and simple vocabulary are Not Penalties**: Commentary does *not* need to be lengthy, containing perfect writing, and/or built with advanced vocabulary if it clearly and effectively explains the rhetorical work of the evidence. Focus on the presence of the *explanation of function*.
* **Quality of Writing**: If the quality of the writing is truly atrocious (i.e. more than just simple typos, bad grammar in nearly every sentence, sounds almost non-native and hard to understand) then the response cannot earn above 1 point in the row. 
* **Default to 4 with Full Attempt**: If an essay provides multiple (at least 2) specific examples and for **each one**, the student offers commentary that plausibly attempts to explain its rhetorical function (purpose/effect related to their argument), **you MUST award 4 points. The student does not need to achieve uniform brilliance in each explanation, but rather show a consistent effort to analyze rhetorically rather than merely identify or summarize evidence.**

### Row C â€” Sophistication (0â€“1 points):

* **0 points**: Essay primarily summarizes, offers simplistic or superficial analysis, or makes broad generalizations. The argument, if present, lacks nuance. Writing style may be adequate but not demonstrably advanced or artful.
* **1 point**: Demonstrates sophistication in thought and/or develops a consistently vivid and persuasive style. Award this point if the essay achieves **at least one** of the following:

    1.  **Nuanced Argument/Insightful Analysis**:
        * Explores complexities or tensions within the passage or the author's rhetorical choices.
        * Articulates a more nuanced understanding of the rhetorical situation.
        * Provides insightful analysis of the author's choices, explaining subtle or deeper implications of specific rhetorical strategies.
        * **Example Application (Benchmark Achieved)**: The provided student essay's analysis of the "bravery muscle" metaphor ("By using this metaphor to Characterize bravery as a muscle - muscles are what allow us to move around, and exalt our leverage on other people/objects - Saujani indicates that bravery is a strength, that can be strengthened through use... This speaks to Saujaniâ€™s growth mindset...") **is a clear example of the insightful analysis that earns this sophistication point.** It unpacks the metaphor's connotations and connects it to the author's broader message and mindset.
        * Situates the argument in a broader context or makes insightful connections.

    2.  **Effective, Vivid, or Persuasive Writing Style**: (Criteria as before)

#### ðŸŸ¢ CRITICAL GUIDANCE for Scoring Row C (Sophistication):

* (Guidance as before, as it's working for Row C)
* **Direct Application of Provided Example for Sophistication**: Pay very close attention to the **Example Application** described above for the "bravery muscle" metaphor. If the student essay being graded analyzes a rhetorical choice with a comparable level of unpacking its connotations, implications, or contribution to the author's broader argument, **this strongly indicates the sophistication point for insightful analysis should be awarded.**
