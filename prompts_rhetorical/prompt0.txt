OFFICIAL AP® ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND COMPOSITION 2024 SCORING GUIDELINES — RHETORICAL ANALYSIS:

Row A — Thesis (0–1 points):
0 points: There is no defensible thesis; the thesis only restates the prompt or part of the passage; or the thesis provides summary without analyzing the writer’s rhetorical choices.  Examples that fall into this category: "Reshma Saujani, who founded the organization Girls Who Code, wrote about bravery in the anthology American Like Me: Reflections on Life" (restates prompt), "In her essay, Saujani talks about her parents’ bravery after they immigrated to the United States." (makes a claim, but does not address the writer's rhetorical choices), "Saujani’s parents chose to Americanize their names in order to assimilate into American culture, thereby paving the way for their daughter’s
authenticity." (repeats provided information in the passage.)

1 point: Responds to the prompt with a defensible thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices. Examples that fall into this category: "Reshma Saujani uses comparison and contrast, repetition, and evocative imagery to convey what bravery means to her", "In her essay, Saujani repeats key words and sentence structures to highlight the link between her parents’ choices and those she has made in her career as a politician and non-profit leader", "In Reshma's passage she conveys the message that it is better to be brave and take chances even if you fail, so you can stand apart from the crowd and make a change instead of blending in. Saujani is able to convey this message by first describing a time where she was brave but suffered failures and secondly demonstrating how the failures did not set her back from achieving great things".

Additional Notes on Row A (Thesis): 
  • The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity.
  • The thesis may be anywhere within the response.
  • The thesis may not simply repeat from the passage (responses that simply quote the entire passage should earn zero in every field)
  • For a thesis to be defensible, the passage must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student need not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point.
  • The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point.
  • A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.


Row B — Evidence and Commentary (0–4 points):
0 points: Simply restates the thesis, repeats provided information, or offers irrelevant details, like simply repeating the passage itself.
• Evidence: Provides no evidence, or simply repeats parts of or entire passage without explanation.  
• Commentary: Provides no commentary or incoherent commentary on the evidence provided. Or provides commentary without evidence.  

Typical responses that earn one point tend to focus on summary or description of a passage rather than specific details or techniques. They sometimes mention rhetorical choices with little or no explanation. 
1 point:  
  • Evidence: Provides mostly general evidence.  
  • Commentary: Summarizes evidence without explaining how it supports the line of reasoning. 
  Typical responses that earn one point tend to focus on summary or description of a passage rather than specific details or techniques. They sometimes mention rhetorical choices with little or no explanation. 
2 points:  
  • Evidence: Provides some specific, relevant evidence.  
  • Commentary: Explains how some evidence relates to the line of reasoning, but the line of reasoning is faulty or incomplete. 
  Typical responses that earn two points consist of a mix of specific evidence and broad generalities. They may contain some simplistic inaccurate, or repetitive explanations that don't strengthen the argument. They may make one point well but either do not make multiple supporting claims or do not adequately support more than one claim. They may not explain the connections or progression between the student's claims so a line of reasoning is not established. 
3 points:  
  • Evidence: Provides specific evidence to support all claims in a line of reasoning.  
  • Commentary: Explains how some evidence supports the line of reasoning and how at least one rhetorical choice contributes to the writer’s purpose. 
  Typical responses that earn three points uniformly offer evidence to support claims. They focus on the importance of sepcific words and details from the passage to build an argument. They organize an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims. Commentary may fail to integrate some evidence or fail to support a key claim. 
4 points:  
  • Evidence: Provides specific evidence to support all claims in a line of reasoning.  
  • Commentary: Consistently explains how the evidence supports the line of reasoning and how multiple rhetorical choices contribute to the writer’s purpose.
  Typical responses that earn 4 points uniformly offer evidence to support claims. They focus on the importance of specific words and details from the passage to build an argument. They organize and support an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims, each with adequate evidence that is clearly explained. The explain how the writer's use of rhetorical choices contributes to the student's interpretation of the passage. 

Row C — Sophistication (0–1 points):
0 points: Does not meet the criteria for sophistication. Typical responses in this category: 
• Attempt to contextualize the text, but such attempts consist
predominantly of sweeping generalizations (“In a world where...”
OR “Since the beginning of time...”).
• Only hint at or suggest other arguments (“While some may argue
that... ” OR “Some people say...”).
• Examine individual rhetorical choices but do not examine the
relationships among different choices throughout the text.
• Oversimplify complexities in the text.
• Use complicated or complex sentences or language that is
ineffective because it does not enhance their analysis. 

1 point: Demonstrates sophistication of thought and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation (e.g., explains significance of complexities, relationships among choices, or employs a vivid, persuasive style).
Responses that earn this point may demonstrate sophistication of thought and/or a
complex understanding of the rhetorical situation by doing any of the following:
1. Explaining the significance or relevance of the writer’s rhetorical choices (given the
rhetorical situation).
2. Explaining a purpose or function of the passage’s complexities or tensions.
3. Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive. 

PAST STUDENT RESPONSES WITH SCORES AND COMMENTARY:

Sample 2A — Score: 1-4-1 (Total: 6)  
Passage excerpt: “Reshma Saujani offers her ‘interpretation of bravery, which she defines as a strength intrinsic for one’s unique identity, and often exemplifies in one’s willingness to ditch conformity for progress & individualistic expression.’”  
• Thesis (1): “Reshma Saujani uses metaphors, repetition, and character types to convey what bravery means.”  
• Evidence & Commentary (4):  
  – “By using the muscle metaphor (‘muscles are what allow us to move around…’) Saujani indicates that bravery is a strength that grows through choice.”  
  – “In discussing ‘key-chain Rita,’ she illustrates how naming functions as defiance, reinforcing her argument for individual bravery.”  
• Sophistication (1): The analysis explains the nuanced growth-mindset metaphor and links it to the rhetorical situation.

Sample 2B — Score: 1-3-0 (Total: 4)  
Passage excerpt: “Through her language like ‘I could never turn my back on Reshma to become a Key-Chain Rita,’ Saujani uses her name to symbolize her bravery.”  
• Thesis (1): Defensible thesis identifying use of naming and attribution to parents.  
• Evidence & Commentary (3):  
  – “The name metaphor supports her claim that bravery involves honoring identity.”  
  – “However, the commentary on her parents’ actions (‘demonstrating her respect…’) does not fully connect to her overarching purpose.”  
• Sophistication (0): Competent but fails to examine complexities or their significance.

Sample 2C — Score: 1-2-0 (Total: 3)  
Passage excerpt: “‘I bravely lost by a landslide,’ repeated to emphasize her willingness to risk failure.”  
• Thesis (1): Defensible but general.  
• Evidence & Commentary (2):  
  – “Repetition of ‘bravely’ shows emphasis, but commentary does not explain how it advances the argument.”  
  – “Discussion of ‘confident tone’ lacks connection to purpose.”  
• Sophistication (0): Mentions audience but fails to develop complexity or relationships among choices.
