      "source": "Years later, when I ran for political office for the first time, I was exercising my bravery again. I had enjoyed several years of a lucrative career at a Wall Line Street law firm but longed to make my life more about helping to build communities and improving the future of this country. I wanted to push myself. And much like barging into Schaumburg High to start a diversity club, the idea of running for public office felt good—like I was flexing that bravery muscle again. So I bravely quit my job. I bravely ran for Congress. And I bravely lost by a landslide. But I did it authentically, as myself, as Reshma. In the early stages of campaigning, I was told to change my name to Rita, given the advice that people are more likely to vote for you if they can pronounce your name. But my bravery had brought me this far. I wasn’t going to stop now. I could never turn my back on Reshma to become a Key-Chain Rita. And losing authentically allowed me to articulate something I was passionate about. I wanted to find a way to address the fact that American girls are often raised to value perfection over bravery. They want to be Sweet Valley Jessicas instead of Schaumburg Reshmas. So I ran my campaign on a platform of bringing computer science into every classroom and making sure girls were given equal access to learning coding. I focused on this because the process of learning to code—building something from the ground up, using trial and error, failing and starting over—allows you to see for yourself that perfection is pretty pointless. And bravery leads to wonderful things. I should know. After the election loss, I had the gall to start a national nonprofit called Girls Who Code, and I don’t even know how to code, myself. But thanks to my childhood, growing up with two very brave immigrants as parents—who just like me were children of immigrants in Uganda—I now know it is more important than ever to be brave and proud of my identity, to own my role in changing the world, one election loss at a time. Yes, I did run for office again a few years later. And yes, I lost again. But bravery is contagious. On election day, I was running around in the rain shaking voters’ hands up to the very last minute. I met a woman—I did not catch her name—who was rushing to the polls. As she passed by me, I smiled and said, \"Who are you voting for today?\" She hesitated, flustered but kind. Embarrassed she couldn’t pronounce it correctly, she fumbled out an \"uhh\" as she frantically pulled one of my fliers from her bag.\"This woman,\" she said as she pointed at my name on the piece of paper. Even though she needed a cheat sheet to remember who she was voting for, I couldn’t help but swell with pride that I had an Indian name. I couldn’t help but think of my parents. When they chose to name me Reshma, did they dream of a world where it would be unthinkable to go by Rita instead? I had spent years assimilating as a child, and for the first time, I thought I knew why my parents named me Reshma. Maybe they didn’t want me to blend in as much as I thought. They blended in so I wouldn’t have to. They paid the ultimate price for my authenticity. They gave up their community, their careers, their language, their own names. These were the steep taxes they paid to make a better life for me. Assimilating in the ways my parents did can invite accusations. Changing your name and hiding your accent could be seen as passive or fearful gestures. But my parents’ immigrant experience reveals the great reserves of bravery and pride they had in order to survive in a new country with no familiar community of support. I think my parents are the bravest people I know. They traded in their names for the freedom and privilege I experience every day. Because of them, I have the platform to be brave.

      "essay": "In her contribution to American Like Me: Reflections on Life Between Cultures, a 2018 Anthology of essays by diverse, multicultural Americans, Indian-American attorney, author and activist Reshma Saujani offers her interpretation of bravery which she defines as a strength intrinsic for one's unique identity, and often exemplifies in one's willingness to ditch conformity for progress & individualistic expression. Saujani expertly communicates this powerful message through the use of metaphors, repetition and Character types. [cite: 21]\n\nSaujani’s use of metaphors helps the reader, who is likely interested in learning about how a diverse range of people with multicultural backgrounds reflect the American identity visualize through Saujani's unique lens, the nature of bravery. Saujani describes her brave actions as \"flexing that bravery muscle\"[cite: 21]. By using this metaphor to Characterize bravery as a muscle - muscles are what allow us to move around, and exalt our leverage on other people/objects - Saujani indicates that bravery is a strength, that can be strengthened through use. In other words, you can become more brave by making brave choices. This speaks to Saujani’s growth mindset, where she believes she can make positive change. Saujani uses another metaphor to describe the struggles of her parents, Characterizing their struggles as \"steep taxes\" (line 66). [cite: 21, 26] Saujani describes the sacrifices her parents made - giving up their community, their careers, their language, their own names (lines 65-68) - as taxes which are typically costs deducted from a benefit, such as owning a home or earning an income. Saujani appreciates the bravery of her parents to make these sacrifices so that they, and their daughter could have a better life. Saujani's parents actions are a prime example of her definition of bravery - the willingness to ditch conformity for progress. [cite: 26]\n\nSaujani uses Character types - people or prototypes that represent larger ideas such as Romeo and Juliet being star-crossed lovers, or Einstein being a genius - such as \"Sweet Valley Jessicas\" and Schaumburg Reshmas to further the readers understanding of her view of the nature of bravery. She uses \"Sweet Valley Jessicas\" (line 22) and \"Key-Chain Rita\" (line 18) to Characterize the person society has pressured her to become, the American girl \"raised to value perfection over bravery\" (lines 21-22). Meanwhile, she characterizes her brave, bold, individualistic ideal as \"Schaumburg Reshma\" (line 23). Saujani uses these Character types to communicate and hammer-home one of the main facets of her view of the nature of bravery - a strength intrinsic to one's unique identity, in a memorable way.

      "essay": "In Resham Saujani’s excerpted contribution to American Like Me: Reflections on Life Between Cultures, she illustrates bravery through her own experience of running for Congress as a second generation Indian Immigrant and woman. [cite: 31] Through her employment of her unusual name as a symbol of her bravery and her attribution of her achievements to her parents, Saujani conveys from a first-person perspective her experience of being brave in order to impact others. [cite: 32]\nSaujani highlights her troubles as a minority Indian woman running for a political office starting with her name. [cite: 33] She was told to change her name so that it’s pronounciation would be easier, but she then describes how she chose not to, using her name as a symbol of defiance against the mainstream. [cite: 34] Through her language like \"I could never turn my back on Reshma to become a Key-Chain Rita\", and \"they want to be Sweet Valley Jessicas instead of Schaumburg Reshmas\", Saujani uses her name to symbolize her bravery, advancing her viewpoint that \"bravery leads to wonderful things\". [cite: 35]\nIn addition, Saujani also gives credit to her parents, who she described as making sacrifices for her so that she wouldn’t have to. [cite: 36] She refers back to her name, saying they changed their name so I wouldn’t have to. This helped her narrative by demonstrating her respect and appreciation for her parent’s bravery, using it to further propel her argument for the importance of bravery and defiance against mainstream. [cite: 37]\nSaujani portrays bravery using her example of running for Congress, illustrating her bravery from her name and her parent’s sacrifices. [cite: 38]",

      "essay": "In this passage, Reshma Saujani uses many moves to develop the message. The nature of bravery is so well developed using confident tones, transitions and connections.\n\nStarting off, Saujani uses a confident tone of voice to develop her theme of bravery. \"I bravely\" is repeated multiple times throughout the beginning paragraph showing the reader that not only is she confident enough to do these things, she is confident enough to admit that she \"bravely lost by a landslide (line 11). This tone is followed through the entirety of the passage, in the fifth paragraph demonstrated again through her confidence, \"yes, I did run for office again a few years later. And yes, I lost again\" Showing the reader \"the nature\" of bravery and where its development/origin comes from.\n\nAnother example that Saujani used to develop their message was the transitions from the reptition of \"I\" or \"I bravely\" in the first paragraph to \"they\" in the last this depict the ways that confidence + bravery are developed. Starting off with her use of \"I bravely\" shows the reader that she has already developed the skills + how they can but ending on \"they\" she discusses her parents role in her development.\n\nLastly, Saujani connects with her audience as a way to build trust. She uses simple, easy to glance over examples to almost resemble the most unconstant struggle for many immigrant/ethnic adolecents. She tells about how she was told to change her name to \"Rita\" and that \"[she] could never turn [her] back on Reshma to become a key-chain Rita.\" which shows her recollection of a childhood incedent.\n\nIn conclusion, Rashma Saujani uses wonderful choices to develop her message about the nature of bravery. By choosing strong moves like tone, shifts in perspective and developing credability Saujani developed their message with great success.",

  "source": "In the summer of 1993 I noticed that my English flash card lessons were starting to pick up, along with talk that my departure date to Canada was drawing even nearer. I didn’t like that one bit. My whole family—my yéye, na˘inai, gu¯gu, gu¯fu¯, even my cousin JingJing—spoke of this \"Canada\" as if it were some sort of idyllic paradise, a place of abundant snacks and endless affection.\"You can eat whatever you want,\" Na˘inai would say, as if I didn’t already have pretty regular access to all of my favorites on Héxìnglù.\"You will finally reunite with your parents,\" my gu¯gu added reassuringly, as if I didn’t already have five amazing people around me who loved me. Looking back, it felt kind of cult-y, like gospel from the Church of Canadology that I was supposed to just accept. I played along, even though I was still rough on the exact terms of this proposition. Sure, I welcomed the thought of meeting more members of my family . . . but I had no idea that said new family members would come at the cost of everyone that I knew and loved. So, with about as much agency as any four-year-old possessed, I kept on, ever the obedient child, dutifully memorizing my English flash cards.  (píngguo)—Apple.  (ma¯o)—Cat.  (xia¯ngjia¯o)—Banana.  (bàbama¯ma)—Parents, whom I would meet in the winter. An air of excitement permeated our household in the days leading up to my father’s arrival in late December. Word had come to us that Bàba would fly over to pick me up and escort me back to Canada, while Ma¯ma would meet us at the airport once we landed in Toronto. If my grandparents were dreading letting me go (they were), they went to great lengths not to show it. We made a big WELCOME BACK sign in giant letters and hung it on our door. I wore my nicest clothes on the day, an outfit of absolute fire consisting of a collared rugby shirt with blue and purple stripes, a pair of brown overalls with yellow polka dots and a vest that looked like a burlap sack. That’s right, I was pattern clashing way before it was cool. My gu¯gu and gu¯fu¯ came over and we prepared a feast that filled our little round table: white mushrooms with sliced pork, large tail-on shrimp, bean curd, soy-sauce ribs and Russian-style red sausage—my father’s favorite, apparently. The food is starting to get cold when we hear a little knock on our door. I perk up anxiously as my yéye answers, opening the door to reveal a scrawny, square-faced man with bowl-cut hair wearing a big cozy sweater along with the bleary gaze of exhaustion that comes after an eighteen-hour train ride from Beijing. This man who resembles an Asian Eric Forman from That ’70s Show is my bàba, the man who I had waited my entire four-and-a-half-year life to reunite with. This is the man who is going to bring me to the promised land of Canada. \"Máomao! It’s me!\" I freeze. I had imagined this moment in my head many times, as I’m sure my father had. I wanted to run to him, embracing him enthusiastically and without any reservations, as any child would run to their own father—but I just . . . can’t. Everything about this man is foreign to me, from his voice to his smell. I had only seen his face in photographs, only heard recordings of his disembodied voice. He feels almost like a celebrity, someone I recognize from somewhere, but who is himself unknown and unknowable. I scurry to my na˘inai’s side nervously. I’m sure my father was a little disappointed, but he respected my space, taking only a small step toward me. \"Do you know who I am?\" I ponder this for a moment.\"You . . . you are Zhenning Liu.\" Everyone around me bursts out laughing. The ice is broken, and I laugh along, even though I don’t get the joke. \"Zhenning Liu\" is exactly who this man is to me; not \"Dad,\" not \"Father,\" not \"Bàba\" . . . but a stranger, an acquaintance at best. Slowly, over the next few days, it dawns on me that this stranger is going to take me away from my family, my home and everything that I have ever known.",
  "essay": "In the memoir, *We Were Dreamers: An Immigrant Superhero Origin Story*, Simu Liu narrates how he prepared and came to accept his eventual leave to Canada and portrays his relationship with his family in China versus with his father in order to highlight that fear and difficulty that comes with acceptance and change and the hardships in leaving people behind and starting over, ultimately moving the audience to realize that although scary, change is something that happens to everyone and that they must persevere through it, and eventually, embrace it. Simu Lie narrates the events leading up to his departure from China and how he prepared for his new life in Canada in order to highlight how difficult and scary change can be, as well as the acceptance of it. Take, for example, as Simu Lie's family attempts to convince him that his move to Canada will be great because of all the food he can eat and because he is meeting his parents, Lie is skeptical and believes that he has all his favorite foods right there in Hexinglu and he \"already had five amazing people around [him] who loved [him],\" (Lie 3). This establishes Lie's point that change is hard to accept and is difficult to prepare for, as well as his point that it is hard to see the other side of change. Furthermore, Lie narrates that although he didn't know exactly what was going on he simply \"played along,\" (Lie 6). This further establishes Lie's point that change is often unexpected and although one can prepare for it, it is still scary and difficult when it comes and the best one can do is to simply play along and attempt to accept it. Lie is able to establish an emotional connection with the audience because many of them can relate to his experiences, as lots of people have had to move places throughout their lives and leave family and friends behind. This is important because Lie reminds the audience of the difficulty and fear during this time, but that they also were able to persevere through it and adapt. This helps further resonate Lie's point with the audience in that they should take these lessons they learned in the past and apply them to any obstacles in the future. All of this would move the audience to realize that even though change is scary and difficult, they can persevere and attempt to accept it and, eventually even embrace it. Simu Lie portrays the relationship with his family in China versus the one with his father in order to highlight the hardships that come with leaving people behind and starting over. Take, for example, as Lie continues to prepare to leave for Canada, he wonders what his parents will be like and if leaving is really worth \"the cost of everyone that [he] knew and loved,\" (Lie 6). This establishes Lie's point that one of the hardest parts about change can be leaving people behind, as well as the hardships that come with dealing with and accepting this. Furthermore, when Lie first meets his father he imagined that he would run up to him and embrace him like a normal child would do to their father. However, when the time comes, Lie freezes up and looks at his father as if he is \"a stranger, an acquaintance at best,\" (Lie 19). This further establishes Lie's point by displaying how scary change can be when having to start over. Lie has to leave behind his life with all his loved ones to start a new life with someone that he perceives to be almost a stranger who is going to \"take [him] away from [his] family, [his] home, and everything that [he had] ever known,\" (Lie 20). All of this would move the audience to realize that starting over and leaving people behind is one of the hardest parts about change, but they must persevere and adapt and, eventually, the change could be for the better. Lie narrates the events leading up to his departure to Canada and his preparation for it and portrays the difference in the relationship that he has with his family in China versus his father in order to illustrate how hard change can be due to leaving people behind and starting over, ultimately moving the audience to persevere through change, and eventually even embrace it with the knowledge that it could be for the better.",

If my grandparents were dreading letting me go (they were), they went to great lengths not to show it. We made a big WELCOME BACK sign in giant letters and hung it on our door. I wore my nicest clothes on the day, an outfit of absolute fire consisting of a collared rugby shirt with blue and purple stripes, a pair of brown overalls with yellow polka dots and a vest that looked like a burlap sack. That’s right, I was pattern clashing way before it was cool. My gu¯gu and gu¯fu¯ came over and we prepared a feast that filled our little round table: white mushrooms with sliced pork, large tail-on shrimp, bean curd, soy-sauce ribs and Russian-style red sausage—my father’s favorite, apparently. The food is starting to get cold when we hear a little knock on our door. I perk up anxiously as my yéye answers, opening the door to reveal a scrawny, square-faced man with bowl-cut hair wearing a big cozy sweater along with the bleary gaze of exhaustion that comes after an eighteen-hour train ride from Beijing. This man who resembles an Asian Eric Forman from That ’70s Show is my bàba, the man who I had waited my entire four-and-a-half-year life to reunite with. This is the man who is going to bring me to the promised land of Canada. \"Máomao! It’s me!\" I freeze. I had imagined this moment in my head many times, as I’m sure my father had. I wanted to run to him, embracing him enthusiastically and without any reservations, as any child would run to their own father—but I just . . . can’t. Everything about this man is foreign to me, from his voice to his smell. I had only seen his face in photographs, only heard recordings of his disembodied voice. He feels almost like a celebrity, someone I recognize from somewhere, but who is himself unknown and unknowable. I scurry to my na˘inai’s side nervously. I’m sure my father was a little disappointed, but he respected my space, taking only a small step toward me. \"Do you know who I am?\" I ponder this for a moment.\"You . . . you are Zhenning Liu.\" Everyone around me bursts out laughing. The ice is broken, and I laugh along, even though I don’t get the joke. \"Zhenning Liu\" is exactly who this man is to me; not \"Dad,\" not \"Father,\" not \"Bàba\" . . . but a stranger, an acquaintance at best. Slowly, over the next few days, it dawns on me that this stranger is going to take me away from my family, my home and everything that I have ever known.",
  "essay": "Simu Liu wrote a memoir about his bittersweet experience as a Chinese immigrant. Liu effectively delivers his experiences as an immigrant child while also allowing the audience to empathize with his story through his smooth and meticulous implementation of rhetorical devices such as diction, imagery, and repetition. One rhetorical device that can be easily identified in the passage is diction. One notable use of diction that stood out to me was in paragraph 6, where he modified the word cult, and added a y to the end of it, to make it \"cult-y.\" First of all, this change allows for the word to be more easily understood by an audience who did not have the experience. He described the situation in a more relatable way that the audience would be able to easily decipher. The already well-known word of cult, with a y attached to the end, indicating that is an adjective meant to describe the situation, made it easy to understand the feeling of the atmosphere that he was in. Another example of diction is \"this man\" or just \"man,\" repeated throughout the latter part of the passage. This is important to pay attention to as it illuminates the relationship Liu had with his father, or rather, the bitter attitude Liu had towards his father as he felt he was taking away from his life and current family. Calling his father \"man\" indicates that Liu did not know his father as someone who, from my perspective, you throw ball with or receive giant hugs from. Instead, this man was foreign to him, which he elaborated on in paragraph 14. Lastly, the use of the word man could have an ironic interpretation, as it is often a term used to describe a somewhat untouchable person of great importance. In paragraph 11, consisting of one sentence, the satirical expression of his father as being someone who can accomplish great and difficult tasks such as \"bringing [him] to the promised land of Canada\" reveals Liu’s true attitude towards his father, which is a lack of respect by undermining him. Another rhetorical device used that makes the writing style of the author stronger is imagery. In paragraph 8 of the excerpt from Liu’s memoir, he described a big welcome sign. He used all caps for the \"welcome sign\" to illustrate in the minds of the audience what the sign looked like. He follows this method of capitalization by describing the sign as having giant letter and hung on their door to further reveal what the sign looked like, which is a great use of imagery. Additionally, imagery is utilized in the following paragraph. He describes the meal that was partaken in celebration of his family’s immigration to Canada. Extensive detail is used in this paragraph to describe what the feast looked like and the specifics of the contents of the meal through adjectives such as white to describe the mushrooms, sliced, to indicate the type of pork, and so on. Again the imagery used here to describe the feast gives the audience an accurate representation of what the feast may have been like or looked like, given that the audience reading this portion was not there to experience the feast. Lastly, repetition is a very important and notable rhetorical device used in this snippet of Liu’s memoir. As discussed above, Liu identified and described his father simply as \"this man.\" This phrase and word choice is repeated throughout paragraphs 11 through 14, and the use of repetition in this instance has great significance. Again, as previously mentioned, the use of the word choice \"man\" shows how there was a lack of an emotional connection between the father and the son. Repetition further intensifies this effect. Repeating this man, rather than identifying his father as a man once, emphasizes the fact that Liu will never see his \"real\" father as more than just a man. So, to conclude, Liu creates a very well written analysis of his experience through his use of diction, imagery, and repetition. These rhetorical devices in turn, make the situation easier for the audience to understand and identify with.",

  "source": "In the summer of 1993 I noticed that my English flash card lessons were starting to pick up, along with talk that my departure date to Canada was drawing even nearer. I didn’t like that one bit. My whole family—my yéye, na˘inai, gu¯gu, gu¯fu¯, even my cousin JingJing—spoke of this \"Canada\" as if it were some sort of idyllic paradise, a place of abundant snacks and endless affection.\"You can eat whatever you want,\" Na˘inai would say, as if I didn’t already have pretty regular access to all of my favorites on Héxìnglù.\"You will finally reunite with your parents,\" my gu¯gu added reassuringly, as if I didn’t already have five amazing people around me who loved me. Looking back, it felt kind of cult-y, like gospel from the Church of Canadology that I was supposed to just accept. I played along, even though I was still rough on the exact terms of this proposition. Sure, I welcomed the thought of meeting more members of my family . . . but I had no idea that said new family members would come at the cost of everyone that I knew and loved. So, with about as much agency as any four-year-old possessed, I kept on, ever the obedient child, dutifully memorizing my English flash cards.  (píngguo)—Apple.  (ma¯o)—Cat.  (xia¯ngjia¯o)—Banana.  (bàbama¯ma)—Parents, whom I would meet in the winter. An air of excitement permeated our household in the days leading up to my father’s arrival in late December.

  "essay": "As I read this memoir from Simu Liu I catch a lot from this little part we get to read. Very interesting and its very descriptive with the native language he shows us and the very fond memories he has of each part and the sorta sillyness you get from it. It a lot that makes the book more enjoyable to read. Now one of the first strategies I got from this was his language. Meaning his chinese language. He refrences some of these words all over the text but of my favorite were \"yéye, nǎinai, gūgu, gūfu.\" Whenever he seaks about his family members he always uses his chinese language. Or more importantly the family he most loved and grew up with. Becuase as we see he refers to his dad as \"dad\" not \"Bàba.\" This type of strategy actually makes this passage very interesting. Makes it funner more catching. Its a new way to learn words and the way he uses it, you can tell who we loved a little bit more. Another strategy I got was description. The way he describes every thing he remembers with such precise its actually facinating. You can see it when he talks about the clothes he wore the day he met his dad and the first time he actually saw his dad. \"I wore my nicest clothes on the day, an outfit of absolute fire consisting of a collared rugby shirt with blue and purple strips, a pair of brown overalls with yellow polka dots and a best that looked like a burlap sack.\" \"When we hear a little knock on the door. I perk up anxiously as my yéye answers, openening the door to reveal a scrawny, squared-faced man with bowl-cut hair wearing a big cozy sweater along with the bleary gaze of exhaustion that comes after an eighteen-hour train ride from Beijing.\" Now thats what im talking about. The way he describes what hes wearing with such precise and exactly knowing. And the way he goes from the moment that led up to meeting his dad to exactly knowing what he looked like after so many years. One last one i saw which was minor was a metaphor. Simple as it gets. \"Everyone around me bursts out laughing. The ice is broken and I laugh alone even though I dont get the joke.\" \"The ice is broke\" is a perfect way to show that well it is what is is and were all comfortable with eachother. Now from all that I seen there are most of from what I got but to be honest this memoir is really interesting he brought a little bit of his culture here and showed in the an most interesting way possible. To the way he explains everything is what makes it one of the most funny parts.",

  "source": "As I end my time in the White House, I can think of no better message to send our young people in my last official remarks as First Lady. So for all the young people in this room and those who are watching, know that this country belongs to you — to all of you, from every background and walk of life. If you or your parents are immigrants, know that you are part of a proud American tradition — the infusion of new cultures, talents and ideas, generation after generation, that has made us the greatest country on earth. If your family doesn’t have much money, I want you to remember that in this country, plenty of folks, including me and my husband — we started out with very little. But with a lot of hard work and a good education, anything is possible — even becoming President. That’s what the American Dream is all about. If you are a person of faith, know that religious diversity is a great American tradition, too. In fact, that’s why people first came to this country — to worship freely. And whether you are Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh — these religions are teaching our young people about justice, and compassion, and honesty. So I want our young people to continue to learn and practice those values with pride. You see, our glorious diversity — our diversities of faiths and colors and creeds — that is not a threat to who we are, it makes us who we are. (Applause.) So the young people here and the young people out there: Do not ever let anyone make you feel like you don’t matter, or like you don’t have a place in our American story — because you do. And you have a right to be exactly who you are. But I also want to be very clear: This right isn’t just handed to you. No, this right has to be earned every single day. You cannot take your freedoms for granted. Just like generations who have come before you, you have to do your part to preserve and protect those freedoms. And that starts right now, when you’re young. Right now, you need to be preparing yourself to add your voice to our national conversation. You need to prepare yourself to be informed and engaged as a citizen, to serve and to lead, to stand up for our proud American values and to honor them in your daily lives. And that means getting the best education possible so you can think critically, so you can express yourself clearly, so you can get a good job and support yourself and your family, so you can be a positive force in your communities. And when you encounter obstacles — because I guarantee you, you will, and many of you already have — when you are struggling and you start thinking about giving up, I want you to remember something that my husband and I have talked about since we first started this journey nearly a decade ago, something that has carried us through every moment in this White House and every moment of our lives, and that is the power of hope — the belief that something better is always possible if you’re willing to work for it and fight for it. It is our fundamental belief in the power of hope that has allowed us to rise above the voices of doubt and division, of anger and fear that we have faced in our own lives and in the life of this country. Our hope that if we work hard enough and believe in ourselves, then we can be whatever we dream, regardless of the limitations that others may place on us. The hope that when people see us for who we truly are, maybe, just maybe they, too, will be inspired to rise to their best possible selves. That is the hope of students like Kyra who fight to discover their gifts and share them with the world. It’s the hope of school counselors like Terri and all these folks up here who guide those students every step of the way, refusing to give up on even a single young person. Shoot, it’s the hope of my — folks like my dad who got up every day to do his job at the city water plant; the hope that one day, his kids would go to college and have opportunities he never dreamed of. That’s the kind of hope that every single one of us — politicians, parents, preachers — all of us need to be providing for our young people.

  "essay": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama was known for programs and project that focused on the youth of the United States. Things that would help them become great citizens when they grow up. In her final speech as first lady Obama uses repetition, emotional appeals and allusions to convey her message about her expectations and hope for young people in the US. Former first lady Obama express her message about her hopes and expectations for young people by using allusions and emotional appeals. For example she alludes to the pilgrims reason for coming to the new world in paragraph three when she discusses the tradition of American religious diversity. This allusion is important because it provides an explanation for why we have the freedom of religion and why America is so religiously diverse, because people came here as a fresh start to be away from religious persecution and to practice and belive in whatever they want to belive in. It's important because it explains to her audience of young people that they do not have to be afraid of what they believe in because those differering religions contribute to the makeup of the nation. It exemplifies that part of the rich diversity of the United States is religious diversity it makes the citizens of this nation who they are and it's important because without the US wouldn't be what it is and the ideas and concepts that are shared wouldn't be shared if there was no religious diversity. Obama also uses emotional appeals when she says, \"If your family didn't have much money, I want you to remeber that in this country plenty of folks..... started out with very little.\" This appeal is important because it illustrates how not only is she relating to her audience but also how other people relate with them as well. Her use of appeal in this sentence shows the audience that they are not alone when it comes to things that there are many other people who go through the same things. It's important to her audience of young people who may believe that they are less than because it shows them that they can get just as far as she has. Which conveys her message because it provides her audience hope that no matter the situation with hard work they can do anything they put their minds to and achieve their goals. Obama also uses repetition to convey her message as well. For example when she says, \"If you..\" or \"If your...\" The uses of repitition is important because it emphasizes all the different potential characteristics or circumstances people could be going through. The use of repitition is important because it shows how Obama appeals to everyone, how her message is for everyone not one particular group of people but everyone. Which is important to her audience of young people because young people often have thoughts and questions on whether or not soething applies to them or if they are included or a part of something. The repetition shows to them that they are included that this message applies to them and that her hope and expectations for are applied to them. That she's extending that hope and those expectations to every young person out there. She also uses repition of the word \"you\" throughout her speech.The repeating of the word you is important because it directs the speech back to the audience. It helps to convey the expectation part of her message. It emphasizes that as young people they are the next leaders, the next doctors, the next lawyers etc and emphasizes as they the next generation of leaders that they need to prepare themselves for the challenges ahead but still also be proponents of change. Be the people who fix things, discover new things and make the United States a more free, and just nation by being an engaged citizen. Another example of repetition she uses is the phrase, \"the hope..\" The repetition of this phrase is important because it extends hope and encouragement that they will actively try to make their communities a better place. The repitition of this phrase is important because it illustrates to her audience of young people the hope she has for them. It shows them that she hopes they carry on like their ancestors and the people before them in being people of positive change. It displays to them not only the kind of hope she has but that everyone should have, despite their title, status, or occupation. That everyone should have hope and be hopeful that they can be proponents of change in their communities and their nation.",

  "essay": "A strong powerful woman gave a push to the future generation of America. First lady Michelle Obama gave a speech in her final days in administration to encourage students to continue their education after high school. While speaking to the students at their high school Michelle uses a call to action, and broad speaking to relate and push these students. Michelle states in her speech \"...This right isn’t just handed to you...\" she makes it very clear to these students that this \"right\" is not easy to come about and takes lots of hard work. She reminds them that you will fail and you cannot take freedoms for granted. But that you need to think of this journey now, you need to plan and make sure that you can be successful when it comes to that point in life. \"And that means getting the best education possible...\" she states telling them to get engaged with this American freedom; resulting in a good job, being able to support your family, and being a positive force, as she states in paragraph 5. This first lady wants all students to feel as though they can have a higher education after high school. She never pinpoints one social group or is directly talking to them, making each students feel like they have a chance at success after grade school. She is friendly and keeps everyone in mind, Michelle relates to everyone, even people of many religions, telling them they too can continue their learning of values, \"So I want our young people to continue to learn and practice those values with pride.\" No one should miss out on education in Michelle Obama’s eyes. Obstacles, problems, money issues and all these experiences can be faced throughout schooling. But Michelle Obama wants you to know that nothing is impossible, that every minority has the chance to have a higher life. She pushes us to take that step now to prepare and not let any problem at hand stop you from trying, all students deserve and should have a education after high school.",

And when you encounter obstacles — because I guarantee you, you will, and many of you already have — when you are struggling and you start thinking about giving up, I want you to remember something that my husband and I have talked about since we first started this journey nearly a decade ago, something that has carried us through every moment in this White House and every moment of our lives, and that is the power of hope — the belief that something better is always possible if you’re willing to work for it and fight for it. It is our fundamental belief in the power of hope that has allowed us to rise above the voices of doubt and division, of anger and fear that we have faced in our own lives and in the life of this country. Our hope that if we work hard enough and believe in ourselves, then we can be whatever we dream, regardless of the limitations that others may place on us. The hope that when people see us for who we truly are, maybe, just maybe they, too, will be inspired to rise to their best possible selves. That is the hope of students like Kyra who fight to discover their gifts and share them with the world. It’s the hope of school counselors like Terri and all these folks up here who guide those students every step of the way, refusing to give up on even a single young person. Shoot, it’s the hope of my — folks like my dad who got up every day to do his job at the city water plant; the hope that one day, his kids would go to college and have opportunities he never dreamed of. That’s the kind of hope that every single one of us — politicians, parents, preachers — all of us need to be providing for our young people. Because that is what moves this country forward every single day — our hope for the future and the hard work that hope inspires.",
  "essay": "In her last speech, Michelle Obama uses comparing and contrasting to convey her message about her expectations and hope for young people in the United States. She compares and relates to her and her husband’s life leading up to their spot in the White House to an ordinary citizen. She expresses how they started with very little and with very hard work and time, they were able to work there way up to becoming the President and First Lady of the United States, which is what the American Dream is all about. Many ordinary, and even poorer, United States citizens coming from all different backgrounds and religions can do what they did through hard work and education. She states, \"If your family doesn’t have much money, I want you to remember that in this country, plenty of folks, including me and my husband----we started out with very little. But with a lot of hard work and a good education, anything is possible----even becoming President. That’s what the American Dream is all about.\" She compares to life to an average citizens life to actively display how they are capable of doing exactly what her and her husband did, while trying to encourage those people to work hard to get there, putting in effort and continuing their education after high school.",
