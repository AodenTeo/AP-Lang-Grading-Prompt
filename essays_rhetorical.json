      "essay": "Throughout the entirety of her commencement speech given at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville on May 21, 2016, Rita Dove persuades her audience, the graduating class, to pursue a life of passion through the use of several rhetorical devices.\n\nDove begins her speech by acknowledging the many great accomplishments of the graduating class. She lists the many events that they have lived through, such as “the great digital switchover, Y2K,” “a president impeached,” and “the first black president.” Through this, Dove relates to the students by reminding them of the many important events that have occurred throughout their lives. She also establishes herself as a knowledgeable speaker because she is aware of the significant historical events that have occurred during the graduates’ lives. By connecting with the graduates, Dove is able to ingratiate herself with the audience, thus making them more likely to listen to her message.\n\nAfter connecting with the graduates, Dove moves into the main message of her speech: to live a life of passion. She supports this message through the use of a story her father used to tell her about a young centipede who became too self-conscious to walk. Dove uses this story as an analogy for the graduates’ lives. She warns them not to become “perplexed” by “endless self-examination,” as this will only lead to inaction. By using this analogy, Dove is able to effectively convey her message in a way that is both memorable and impactful. The graduates are more likely to remember the story of the centipede than a simple command to “follow your passions.”\n\nFinally, Dove concludes her speech by sharing some of her own life experiences. She discusses the many roles she has held, such as “daughter,” “sister,” “wife,” and “mother.” Through this, she conveys to the graduates that she, too, has experienced the struggles of life. She also encourages the graduates to “dare to be different” and to “listen” to the voice inside of them that says “I am enough.” By sharing her own experiences, Dove establishes herself as a credible and relatable figure. This helps to further persuade the graduates to follow her advice.\n\nThrough the use of rhetorical devices such as connection, analogy, and personal experience, Rita Dove effectively conveys her message to the graduating class. She persuades them to pursue a life of passion and to not be afraid of the challenges that may come their way.",
