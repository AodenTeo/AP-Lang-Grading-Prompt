      "question": "Urban rewilding is an effort to restore natural ecological processes and habitats in city environments. Many cities around the world have embraced rewilding as part of larger movements to promote ecological conservation and environmentally friendly design. Now, a movement to promote urban rewilding is beginning to take shape in the United States as well. Carefully read the six sources, including the introductory information for each source. Write an essay that **synthesizes material from at least three of the sources** and **develops your position on the extent to which rewilding initiatives are worthwhile for urban communities to pursue**. ### Sources - **Source A** (infographic from Fastnacht) - **Source B** (Jepson and Schepers policy brief) - **Source C** (NRPA article) - **Source D** (Garland article) - **Source E** (graph from McDonald et al.) - **Source F** (Chatterton book excerpt) --- ### In your response you should do the following: - Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a **defensible position**. - Select and use **evidence from at least three of the provided sources** to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly the sources used through **direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary**. Sources may be cited as *Source A, Source B*, etc., or by using the description in parentheses. - **Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.** - Use **appropriate grammar and punctuation** in communicating your argument.",

The following is excerpted from a policy brief published as a collaboration between the University of Oxford and a nonprofit organization that promotes rewilding in Europe. Rewilding is a powerful new term in conservation. This may be because it combines a sense of passion and feeling for nature with advances in ecological science. The term resonates with diverse publics and seems to have particular appeal to a younger urban generation and among those who want a voice in shaping a new natural environment. Rewilding is exciting, engaging and challenging: it is promoting debate and deliberation on what is natural and the natures we collectively wish to conserve and shape. Rewilding is a multifaceted concept with three broad dimensions that interact with each other: (1) restoring and giving space to natural processes, (2) reconnecting wild(er) nature with the modern economy, and (3) responding to and shaping cosmopolitan perceptions of nature conservation among European society. The following principles are coming to characterize and guide rewilding as a distinct approach to conservation: 1. Restoring natural processes and ecological dynamics—both abiotic such as river flows, and biotic such as the ecological web and food-chain—through reassembling lost guilds of animals in dynamic landscapes. 2. A graduated and situated approach, where the goal is to move up a scale of wildness within the constraints of what is possible, and interacting with local cultural identities. 3. Taking inspiration from the past but not replicating it. Developing new natural heritage and value that evokes the past but shapes the future. 4. Creating self-sustaining, resilient ecosystems (including re-connecting habitats and species populations within the wider landscapes) that provide resilience to external threats and pressures, including the impact of climate change (adaptation). 5. Working towards the ideal of passive management, where once restored, we step back and allow dynamic natural processes to shape conservation outcomes. 6. Creating new natural assets that connect with modern society and economy and promote innovation, enterprise and investment in and around nature areas, leading to new nature-inspired economies. 7. Reconnecting wild nature with conservation entitlement and a recognition that conservation is a culturally dynamic as well as a scientific and technical pursuit. As a new conservation trend, rewilding differs from the more established and newer conservation worldviews. People are combining these in different ways creating different \\\"shades\\\" of rewilding, many of which have labels. This has provoked a backlash in some quarters, and the trend is exposing unwilling to essentialists more interested in maintaining a unity of clarity, consensus and evidence by groups within conservation science. On the other hand it reflects innovation and creates the possibility for a common, but differentiated (situated) mode of conservation: one that is guided by a set of principles that member states or regions can interpret in ways suited to their nature conservation traditions, landscapes, culture and economies.",

The following is excerpted from an article in a magazine published by a nonprofit organization that promotes parks and environmental conservation. \\\"Close your eyes for a moment and picture a place from childhood that’s extremely meaningful,\\\" directed Opening Session keynote speaker Dr. Scott Sampson. \\\"Imagine what it looks like, feels like, who you’re there with, what the smells are.\\\" By an almost unanimous show of hands, Dr. Scott, host and science advisor of the Emmy-nominated PBS KIDS television series \\\"Dinosaur Train\\\" and author of *How to Raise a Wild Child: The Art and Science of Falling in Love with Nature*, illustrated how, for a large number in the audience, that extremely meaningful childhood place involves the outdoors. The audience largely consisted of Baby Boomers/Generation Xers who remember enjoying abundant, unstructured outdoor playtime as kids. For many of today’s youth, those childhood places will look much different. Imagine 25 years from now, he posits, how many hands would be raised in response to the same question about a meaningful childhood place involving the outdoors. \\\"If people don’t spend any time outside, why are they going to care about their local places let alone the national parks in the distance,\\\" he asked. Dr. Scott suggests that \\\"urban rewilding\\\" in our cities and towns is what’s needed to head off this crisis. Rewilding is a term usually used in connection with reintroducing an apex predator into an ecosystem in an attempt to restore balance. A familiar example of this top-down approach to restoring balance would be the efforts to return wolves to Yellowstone Park. Urban rewilding is a bottom up approach that starts with the simple act of planting mostly native plants. They are critical to attracting native insects, which in turn attract birds and various animals back to the local ecosystem. And, if we do urban rewilding right, cities could become places where nature is welcome. And once that happens, we need to help children develop NEW eyes to see nature: to notice it, engage with it—play is an important way for kids to engage with nature and it also allows them to gain some experience with risk-taking, while developing a sense of wonder about it. This movement to \\\"rewild\\\" or \\\"wild\\\" children touches on all three NRPA Pillars—Conservation, Health and Wellness and Social Equity. However, it’s a movement that requires big thinking about what we want the future to look like and for each community that future will look different. It also will require deep collaborative engagement from local park and recreation areas of expertise, each doing their part to achieve the desired results. As Dr. Scott explains: \\\"We’re at a juncture where the decisions we make over the next generation are likely to determine whether our kids—and theirs—will live in a biodiverse, healthy, inspiring world.\\\"",

The following is excerpted from an online discussion of urban rewilding in the United Kingdom hosted by a nonprofit organization that publishes research and writing about cities. The author is the associate director of an environmental consultancy. There are certainly opportunities for introducing re-wilding in rural parts of the UK, in particular in upland regions where, without subsidy, agriculture is economically unviable for the most part. With respect to the UK’s cities, nature should also be allowed to take its own path in certain select locations to create some semblance of wildness. I am unconvinced however that re-wilding is the appropriate terminology or the approach to wildlife restoration that we should be pursuing in UK cities at any meaningful scale. The large expanses of greenspace that would be required to recreate fully functioning wildwood, including relatively large numbers of herbivores and viable populations of naturally scarce predators at the top of food chain, are simply not available in our cities, where space is increasingly at a premium. Sustainable urban design should be seeking to avoid low-density sprawl and instead promote compact, transit-oriented, pedestrian-and-bicycle friendly urban development that provides easy access to services. This development model is crucial for tackling congestion and for reducing CO2 and other harmful emissions. Given this compact city imperative, the proposition of devoting large areas of urban space for re-wilding in anything approaching its true sense is untenable. Some authors/practitioners respond that there should be no minimum area thresholds for wilderness and re-wilding from an ecological perspective, frequently quoting Aldo Leopold who declared that \\\"no tract of land is too small for the wilderness idea\\\". While it is true that ecosystems can be considered at the microcosm, there really is not the space available to recreate complex self-sustaining food webs, with meaningful ranges of predators and prey, in accordance with the true principles of re-wilding. Even ignoring the seeming disregard for matters relating to population viability analysis and the principles of island biogeography, other concerns remain. In those small areas where nature can be left to its own devices, many people may have a profound dislike for the outcome that sometimes emerges. Negative comments may be expressed relating to perceptions of safety, the appearance of neglected, reduced accessibility and visual/aesthetic preference. With respect to the last of these concerns, while education programs can attune people’s valuation patterns, within an urban context a great many people will continue to favor more ordered, manicured environments. Undeniably, a previously accessible urban greenspace that has been left to nature, which then rapidly succeeds into a monoculture of impenetrable bramble or butterfly-bush, is unlikely to be well-received by most local residents. The disturbed nature of urban soils is likely to be another major limiting factor, impoverished as they frequently are in terms of seedbank, organic material and soil organisms. Without active management newly emerging vegetation would also be subject to degradation by trampling, visual and noise disturbance, fire, invasive species, effects of rodent or pet predation, etc. To reiterate, unencumbered natural succession may well produce landscapes in urban areas dramatically less visually and ecologically appealing than anticipated.",

      "sourceF": "Chatterton, Paul. *Unlocking Sustainable Cities: A Manifesto for Real Change.* Pluto Press, 2019. The following is an excerpt from a book exploring the benefits of urban rewilding. We are beginning to see a proliferation of hybrid natural and built forms through, for example, living walls, rooftop farms, vertical or sky gardens and breathing buildings. These can have significant beneficial effects. For example, urban street canyons refer to the effect created by high buildings lining a street, which can become hotspots for harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. A study by Thomas Pugh and colleagues from the Lancaster Environment Centre suggests that strategic placement of vegetation in street canyons can cut air pollution by up to 30 per cent. They can also stop urban overheating and provide effective insulation and shading for buildings, as well as reducing noise pollution. And of course, there are the psychological and aesthetic benefits of being proximate to an abundance of natural greenery. Green corridors and linear parks can be retrofitted into the existing city. For example, the High Line project in New York transformed an old rail line into a nearly two-mile urban park. It opened in 2014 and became a short cut for walkers and one of the city’s favourite parks featuring art installations and places for hanging out. Other cities are following suit including Chicago’s 606 Park and Toronto’s Bentway, which has slotted 55 outdoor rooms under its Gardiner Expressway featuring farmers’ markets, performance spaces and a children’s garden. Miami is also building the Underline, a nine-mile linear park underneath its metrorail line. In my own city of Leeds, a community group is attempting to do the same thing on one of Leeds’ abandoned Victorian train viaducts. The Madrid Rio project was one of the most exciting urban reclamation projects in Europe—burying a former ring road to create over 600 hectares of parkland. Efforts are being made not just to create greenspaces, but to create interconnected green corridors. For example, the All London Green Grid (ALGG) is the green infrastructure strategy for London, which sets out a vision to create an interconnected network of green and blue spaces across the entire city. It is this interconnection that is so important in terms of creating space for biodiversity to move more extensively. Singapore is one of the pioneers of placing nature at the heart of its planning and urban design process. As a self-labelled garden city, it now prefers to call itself \\\"the city in a garden.\\\" To realize this vision of living in an urban park, Singapore implemented a landscape replacement policy whereby any greenery removed during construction has to be reinstated as part of the development. It is estimated that the amount of urban greenery has been at least doubled, but mainly through sky gardens. The city has also built nearly 300km of park connectors to create deeper connections between parks and neighbourhoods.",
      "essay": "There is a debate on whether Urban rewilding is the next step to ecological restoration, as its goal is to restore natural processes and habitats in more urban areas. Rewilding is a worthwhile, beneficial approach to preserving nature, as well as implementing it into more city environments. Enforcing the idea of rewilding in attempts to conserve nature and increase green space sparks opportunity. Writers Jepson, Paul, and Frans Schepers argue that the process \\\"reflects innovation and creates the possibility for a common, but differentiated (situated) mode of conservation\\\" (Document B). Saving as much wildlife as possible is a consistent motive in today’s society. In this case, the fresh concept of rewilding will do more good than harm, if anything at all. There is also a matter of future generations to be recognized. Yes, everyone has heard the cliché of \\\"think about the kids and the world they will live in someday,\\\" but it stands just as strong. In Document C, Dr. Scott proposes a question to his audience of those who may have their doubts. He asks \\\"If people don’t spend any time outside, why are they going to care about their local places let alone the national parks in the distance?\\\" (Document C). Although childhood experiences have evolved over generations, embracing the outdoors should not be something that turns into a fairy tale to future children. Despite the great effects rewilding may have, there are its downsides as well. Writer Lincoln Garland lists off negatives such as \\\"degradation by trampling, visual and noise disturbance, fire, invasive species, effects of predatory pets etc.\\\" (Document D). Sure, going through with the idea of rewilding isn’t going to be an entire, shall I say, \\\"walk in the park.\\\" However, the benefits in the end will outweigh the difficulties along the way, and the goal of restoring nature will have one more task ticked off the list. When taking the time to look, the statistics are right before one’s eyes. Sarah Fastnacht provides the numbers, and they are promising. Going through with rewilding will result in \\\"more than 70% projected extinctions of plants and animals [being] counteracted by restoring only 30% of priority areas\\\" (Document A). Although there is hard work and brain power to be put in, even a little can go a long way. The rewilding process is one that is worthwhile, and a concept that should be strongly considered. Without innovative ideas and change, society is always going to be wishing for a more ecological friendly world, rather than living in one.",

Other cities are following suit including Chicago’s 606 Park and Toronto’s Bentway, which has slotted 55 outdoor rooms under its Gardiner Expressway featuring farmers’ markets, performance spaces and a children’s garden. Miami is also building the Underline, a nine-mile linear park underneath its metrorail line. In my own city of Leeds, a community group is attempting to do the same thing on one of Leeds’ abandoned Victorian train viaducts. The Madrid Rio project was one of the most exciting urban reclamation projects in Europe—burying a former ring road to create over 600 hectares of parkland. Efforts are being made not just to create greenspaces, but to create interconnected green corridors. For example, the All London Green Grid (ALGG) is the green infrastructure strategy for London, which sets out a vision to create an interconnected network of green and blue spaces across the entire city. It is this interconnection that is so important in terms of creating space for biodiversity to move more extensively. Singapore is one of the pioneers of placing nature at the heart of its planning and urban design process. As a self-labelled garden city, it now prefers to call itself \\\"the city in a garden.\\\" To realize this vision of living in an urban park, Singapore implemented a landscape replacement policy whereby any greenery removed during construction has to be reinstated as part of the development. It is estimated that the amount of urban greenery has been at least doubled, but mainly through sky gardens. The city has also built nearly 300km of park connectors to create deeper connections between parks and neighbourhoods.",
        "essay": "When you think about the world you live in, it’s easy to overlook the problems that are happening on an every day basis. Urban communities are often at a decline of success because of the way people live today. Which is becoming different from previous years. Rewilding initiatives are something that will have a positive impact on communities. It is something that should be done in order to help the environment around your community. This is easy to see and understand, as you learn more about this topic/issue. Extinctions of plants and animals, air pollution, big amounts of carbon dioxide and \\\"WHO\\\" limits are all valid reasons as to why rewilding cities would be a positive thing. The blog post published by an architecture and design company that specializes in sustainability in document A shows this idea very clearly. Document A draws out the fact that extinctions of plants and animals and 465 billion tons of carbon dioxide, would simply be sequestered by \\\"restoring only 30% of priority areas\\\" (document A). It’s easy to overlook these simple problems because they aren’t something we think or worry about on a daily basis. It’s important to see images such as this one to get a good understanding about what is actually happening today. Rewilding is a big concept but easily understandable. It’s a powerful term however with the right information, it’s easy to learn about. Rewilding \\\"Combines a sense of passion and feeling for nature with advances in ecological science\\\" (document B). Rewilding nature is important for society as a whole. Those who are passionate about nature, and always wanting the best for the environment are usually the ones who are committed to something like this. Rewilding communities is definitely something that will take a lot of time and effort. But it is something that is worth being done. It’s worth the stress, and the work. The outcome that will occur after this is done, is something that will make people feel accomplished, even if it’s just in the smallest bit. Document B shows this in a really well written way. Rewilding in urban communities is an attempt to better people’s way of living. Some people are against rewilding. They don’t want to do the work, they don’t feel there is a problem, or they simply just don’t care. I can understand why some people might feel \\\"urban rewilding\\\" is pointless. If people don’t spend time outside. If they don’t see for themselves the issues, then why would they care about helping (document C). Dr. Scott in document C suggests that \\\"urban rewilding in our cities and towns is what’s needed to head off this crisis\\\" (document C). Reintroducing better ways of living is important because it allows people the live happier lives. To live in places they feel benefits them. More people than not think that rewilding is a positive thing, and that is something that is important when helping our society. Urban rewilding is worth the work as it is the only thing that will successfully improve the way people live. Also, if urban rewilding is done right, cities could become places where nature is welcome (document C). People should learn more about this, so in reality, it can actually be done.",

The following is excerpted from a policy brief published as a collaboration between the University of Oxford and a nonprofit organization that promotes rewilding in Europe. Rewilding is a powerful new term in conservation. This may be because it combines a sense of passion and feeling for nature with advances in ecological science. The term resonates with diverse publics and seems to have particular appeal to a younger urban generation and among those who want a voice in shaping a new natural environment. Rewilding is exciting, engaging and challenging: it is promoting debate and deliberation on what is natural and the natures we collectively wish to conserve and shape. Rewilding is a multifaceted concept with three broad dimensions that interact with each other: (1) restoring and giving space to natural processes, (2) reconnecting wild(er) nature with the modern economy, and (3) responding to and shaping cosmopolitan perceptions of nature conservation among European society. The following principles are coming to characterize and guide rewilding as a distinct approach to conservation: 1. Restoring natural processes and ecological dynamics—both abiotic such as river flows, and biotic such as the ecological web and food-chain—through reassembling lost guilds of animals in dynamic landscapes. 2. A graduated and situated approach, where the goal is to move up a scale of wildness within the constraints of what is possible, and interacting with local cultural identities. 3. Taking inspiration from the past but not replicating it. Developing new natural heritage and value that evokes the past but shapes the future. 4. Creating self-sustaining, resilient ecosystems (including re-connecting habitats and species populations within the wider landscapes) that provide resilience to external threats and pressures, including the impact of climate change (adaptation). 5. Working towards the ideal of passive management, where once restored, we step back and allow dynamic natural processes to shape conservation outcomes. 6. Creating new natural assets that connect with modern society and economy and promote innovation, enterprise and investment in and around nature areas, leading to new nature-inspired economies. 7. Reconnecting wild nature with conservation entitlement and a recognition that conservation is a culturally dynamic as well as a scientific and technical pursuit. As a new conservation trend, rewilding differs from the more established and newer conservation worldviews. People are combining these in different ways creating different \\\"shades\\\" of rewilding, many of which have labels. This has provoked a backlash in some quarters, and the trend is exposing unwilling to essentialists more interested in maintaining a unity of clarity, consensus and evidence by groups within conservation science. On the other hand it reflects innovation and creates the possibility for a common, but differentiated (situated) mode of conservation: one that is guided by a set of principles that member states or regions can interpret in ways suited to their nature conservation traditions, landscapes, culture and economies.",

The following is excerpted from an article in a magazine published by a nonprofit organization that promotes parks and environmental conservation. \\\"Close your eyes for a moment and picture a place from childhood that’s extremely meaningful,\\\" directed Opening Session keynote speaker Dr. Scott Sampson. \\\"Imagine what it looks like, feels like, who you’re there with, what the smells are.\\\" By an almost unanimous show of hands, Dr. Scott, host and science advisor of the Emmy-nominated PBS KIDS television series \\\"Dinosaur Train\\\" and author of *How to Raise a Wild Child: The Art and Science of Falling in Love with Nature*, illustrated how, for a large number in the audience, that extremely meaningful childhood place involves the outdoors. The audience largely consisted of Baby Boomers/Generation Xers who remember enjoying abundant, unstructured outdoor playtime as kids. For many of today’s youth, those childhood places will look much different. Imagine 25 years from now, he posits, how many hands would be raised in response to the same question about a meaningful childhood place involving the outdoors. \\\"If people don’t spend any time outside, why are they going to care about their local places let alone the national parks in the distance,\\\" he asked. Dr. Scott suggests that \\\"urban rewilding\\\" in our cities and towns is what’s needed to head off this crisis. Rewilding is a term usually used in connection with reintroducing an apex predator into an ecosystem in an attempt to restore balance. A familiar example of this top-down approach to restoring balance would be the efforts to return wolves to Yellowstone Park. Urban rewilding is a bottom up approach that starts with the simple act of planting mostly native plants. They are critical to attracting native insects, which in turn attract birds and various animals back to the local ecosystem. And, if we do urban rewilding right, cities could become places where nature is welcome. And once that happens, we need to help children develop NEW eyes to see nature: to notice it, engage with it—play is an important way for kids to engage with nature and it also allows them to gain some experience with risk-taking, while developing a sense of wonder about it. This movement to \\\"rewild\\\" or \\\"wild\\\" children touches on all three NRPA Pillars—Conservation, Health and Wellness and Social Equity. However, it’s a movement that requires big thinking about what we want the future to look like and for each community that future will look different. It also will require deep collaborative engagement from local park and recreation areas of expertise, each doing their part to achieve the desired results. As Dr. Scott explains: \\\"We’re at a juncture where the decisions we make over the next generation are likely to determine whether our kids—and theirs—will live in a biodiverse, healthy, inspiring world.\\\"",

The following is excerpted from an online discussion of urban rewilding in the United Kingdom hosted by a nonprofit organization that publishes research and writing about cities. The author is the associate director of an environmental consultancy. There are certainly opportunities for introducing re-wilding in rural parts of the UK, in particular in upland regions where, without subsidy, agriculture is economically unviable for the most part. With respect to the UK’s cities, nature should also be allowed to take its own path in certain select locations to create some semblance of wildness. I am unconvinced however that re-wilding is the appropriate terminology or the approach to wildlife restoration that we should be pursuing in UK cities at any meaningful scale. The large expanses of greenspace that would be required to recreate fully functioning wildwood, including relatively large numbers of herbivores and viable populations of naturally scarce predators at the top of food chain, are simply not available in our cities, where space is increasingly at a premium. Sustainable urban design should be seeking to avoid low-density sprawl and instead promote compact, transit-oriented, pedestrian-and-bicycle friendly urban development that provides easy access to services. This development model is crucial for tackling congestion and for reducing CO2 and other harmful emissions. Given this compact city imperative, the proposition of devoting large areas of urban space for re-wilding in anything approaching its true sense is untenable. Some authors/practitioners respond that there should be no minimum area thresholds for wilderness and re-wilding from an ecological perspective, frequently quoting Aldo Leopold who declared that \\\"no tract of land is too small for the wilderness idea\\\". While it is true that ecosystems can be considered at the microcosm, there really is not the space available to recreate complex self-sustaining food webs, with meaningful ranges of predators and prey, in accordance with the true principles of re-wilding. Even ignoring the seeming disregard for matters relating to population viability analysis and the principles of island biogeography, other concerns remain. In those small areas where nature can be left to its own devices, many people may have a profound dislike for the outcome that sometimes emerges. Negative comments may be expressed relating to perceptions of safety, the appearance of neglected, reduced accessibility and visual/aesthetic preference. With respect to the last of these concerns, while education programs can attune people’s valuation patterns, within an urban context a great many people will continue to favor more ordered, manicured environments. Undeniably, a previously accessible urban greenspace that has been left to nature, which then rapidly succeeds into a monoculture of impenetrable bramble or butterfly-bush, is unlikely to be well-received by most local residents. The disturbed nature of urban soils is likely to be another major limiting factor, impoverished as they frequently are in terms of seedbank, organic material and soil organisms. Without active management newly emerging vegetation would also be subject to degradation by trampling, visual and noise disturbance, fire, invasive species, effects of rodent or pet predation, etc. To reiterate, unencumbered natural succession may well produce landscapes in urban areas dramatically less visually and ecologically appealing than anticipated.",

The following is an excerpt from a book exploring the benefits of urban rewilding. We are beginning to see a proliferation of hybrid natural and built forms through, for example, living walls, rooftop farms, vertical or sky gardens and breathing buildings. These can have significant beneficial effects. For example, urban street canyons refer to the effect created by high buildings lining a street, which can become hotspots for harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. A study by Thomas Pugh and colleagues from the Lancaster Environment Centre suggests that strategic placement of vegetation in street canyons can cut air pollution by up to 30 per cent. They can also stop urban overheating and provide effective insulation and shading for buildings, as well as reducing noise pollution. And of course, there are the psychological and aesthetic benefits of being proximate to an abundance of natural greenery. Green corridors and linear parks can be retrofitted into the existing city. For example, the High Line project in New York transformed an old rail line into a nearly two-mile urban park. It opened in 2014 and became a short cut for walkers and one of the city’s favourite parks featuring art installations and places for hanging out.

        "sourceA": "\\\"National Historic Preservation Act.\\\" *National Park Service*, U.S. Department of the Interior, 2 Dec. 2018, nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservation/national-historic-preservation-act.htm. The following is excerpted from a Web site maintained by the United States National Park Service. After World War II, the United States seemed poised at the edge of a limitless future, and its vision of progress was characterized by the sleek and the new. Urban renewal was seen as a way to clear out the slums, get rid of \\\"obsolete\\\" buildings, make space for an exploding population, and accommodate the burgeoning car culture. Wide swaths were demolished: entire blocks, neighborhoods, business districts, all razed to make way for the new. By the 1960s, urban renewal had altered the face of the nation’s cities. But out of this wholesale erasure of the old grew the most important law governing how we treat those places that define our past: the National Historic Preservation Act. It was the first national policy governing preservation and it would shape the fate of many of our historic and cultural sites over the next half-century. There had been earlier measures to foster preservation—the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Historic Sites Act of 1935—but none were as sweeping or as influential as the National Historic Preservation Act. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson convened a special committee on historic preservation. The committee studied the dismal situation, then delivered a report to Congress. Their report, called *With Heritage So Rich*, became a rallying cry for the preservation movement. Up until that time, the National Park Service’s Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) had documented 12,000 places in the United States. By 1966, half of them had either been destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Before the year was out, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act. It was the most comprehensive preservation law the nation had ever known. The act established permanent institutions and created a clearly defined process for historic preservation in the United States. Historic structures that would be affected by federal projects—or by work that was federally funded—now had to be documented to standards issued by the Secretary of the Interior. The law required individual states to take on much more responsibility for historic sites in their jurisdictions. Each state would now have its own historic preservation office and was required to complete an inventory of important sites. The law also created the President’s Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the National Register of Historic Places, an official list not only of individual buildings and structures, but also of districts, objects, and archeological sites that are important due to their connection with the past. With the passage of the act, preservation in the United States became formalized and professionalized. The National Historic Preservation Act was tied to a growing awareness of the past and of community identity. Many communities realized that there was an unexpected economic force behind preservation. The act helped foster heritage tourism, attracting visitors who wanted to experience the past in ways that no book or documentary could match. The distinctive character of old architecture and historic districts became a powerful draw for many Americans, and antidote to anonymous suburbs and strip malls.",
        "sourceB": "Merlino, Kathryn Rogers. *Building Reuse: Sustainability, Preservation, and the Value of Design.* University of Washington Press, 2018. The following is excerpted from a book advocating for more reuse of existing buildings. In the United States, the recognition of value in buildings began with the identification and preservation of historical structures that had played an important part of the story of creating our nation. Historic designation usually takes into consideration national standards of significance set within specific boundaries: to be designated, a building must be proven to be associated with an important moment in local or national history, or with a historical individual or group, or must represent an exceptional architectural style or tradition. Of course, the question of what should be considered \\\"significant\\\" historical and cultural value in a building is often hotly debated by owners, historians, politicians, community groups, and other interested parties. When the terms of significance can’t be established or agreed upon, it becomes practically impossible to \\\"officially\\\" declare something historic—and suddenly, the building lacks \\\"value.\\\" For this reason, basing preservation decisions solely on whether a building has been designated as \\\"historic\\\" significantly limits the way we value and preserve existing buildings. In effect, the word historic saves them, but old or existing does not, and anyone who wants to demolish a building can simply argue that the building lacks historical significance. Considering that \\\"nonhistoric\\\" buildings comprise the vast majority of our existing building stock, we need to broaden our definition of value if we are to maintain cultural and environmental sustainability. Attaching value to buildings exclusively for their architectural, cultural, or historic significance is problematic in three ways. First, only buildings with the highest historic status are considered valuable enough to be protected from demolition, but this type of building represents only a small percentage of designated buildings. As a result, the majority of historic designations are primarily honorific; and while they provide financial incentives for maintaining a building’s character and may give it greater stature and recognition, they do not protect it from demolition. Second, the historic designation process is piecemeal and irregular—and therefore complicated, time-consuming, and discouraging. The result is that only a small fraction of eligible buildings are even nominated, and those that win registry constitute a tiny portion of the buildings that—by the same standards—would qualify. Finally, attaching value to buildings exclusively because of their notarized historical significance ignores the fact that all buildings inherently hold value as environmental artifacts. They are repositories of extracted and manufactured materials and represent expended energy and carbon emissions; and as such, they hold great value as environmental resources. Consequently, while we rigorously recycle our paper, glass, and metal, we do not apply this ethic to our largest manufactured artifacts, our buildings. Regarding our existing building stock as an environmental resource is essential to advancing any agenda of sustainability. The opportunities that older buildings offer are enormous. Older buildings not only have worth as resources or materials but also can be retrofitted with energy-efficient technologies for high performance. In fact, some older buildings already have a head start. Studies show that many older buildings already perform as well as or better than new buildings by many measures.",

It's not historic in the sense that anything especially important happened here—certainly not in the modest rowhouses that make up the bulk of the neighborhood. What \"historic\" means, here and in cities across the country, is that this is a neighborhood where buildings are not supposed to change.\n\nThe law says window frames on Capitol Hill must be wooden, or something that looks very much like wood.

This year, Save Harlem Now! received a grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund to bolster their preservation efforts. And not a moment too soon. Since the early aughts, development in Harlem has ramped up, replacing endemic boutiques, coffee shops, grocery stores, and even the architectural vernacular itself with mirrors or other urban landscapes. \\\"[Bradley] sees historic district designation as a way to slow down development trends, or at least to ensure that the physical history and cultural legacy is retained in Harlem, and I agree with her,\\\" says Brent Leggs, executive director of the Action Fund.",

        "essay": "The world is constantly shifting, growing, and adapting. New advancements are made each and every day to improve the lives of people across the globe. In this ever-changing climate, it’s vital that we hold the time to appreciate how we got to where we are today. Although the process of officially labelling a site as historic can be complicated and difficult, historic preservation laws hold significant value due to the economic, environmental, and cultural benefits that stem from the preservation of historic sites. Despite these many benefits, opponents of preservation argue that the funding aspect creates a barrier to preserving historic places. In fact, 24% of professionals surveyed identified the need for funding as a top challenge to preserving historic places (Source D). However, the economic benefits of preservation are strong enough to outweigh the cost of funding these sites. As seen after the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act, communities saw how historic preservation could \"foster heritage tourism\" (Source A). The protection of historic locations captivated travelers, motivating them to visit historic areas to experience the past. Bringing in tourists not only results in the appreciation of the style and culture of the historic buildings, but also brings business to the town in which the historic sites are located, thereby positively impacting the economy in areas that practice historic preservation. Ultimately, money must be put into these historic sites, but their preservation then stimulates the economy by drawing tourism. Beyond the economic benefits of preserving historic sites also positively impact the environment. Buildings are not merely buildings, they are repositories of extracted and processed materials (Source B). Constructing a building requires significant nonrenewable resources. The demolition of old buildings to replace them with new structures significantly depletes these essential resources. On the other hand, by preserving these old buildings, resources are conserved, promoting sustainability. Additionally, when older buildings are preserved, they can still be altered in ways that allow them to operate using technologies that are just as environmentally friendly as in modern buildings. Unfortunately, there are some limitations to adaptations made to historic buildings, as seen in parts of DC that prohibit installing rooftop solar panels (Source C). However, the preservation of materials outweighs the restrictions on modernization, demonstrating the value of preserving historic buildings. Although preventing changes to historic buildings can inhibit the use of environmentally friendly practices, it is necessary to preserve the past so the cultural and historical legacy of a location is retained. The preservation of history through buildings may not seem essential, as the events took place in the past, but Brent Leggs, executive director of the Action Fund asserts that, \"it’s really about leveraging the power of the place to have a positive impact on people’s lives right now\" (Source E). Leggs is referring to Harlem, a neighborhood that has historically been a center of African American culture. By designating buildings in that neighborhood as historic, the process of gentrification of Harlem will be slowed significantly, preserving the culture of its residents by allowing the community to remain intact. Through historic preservation of buildings, both past and present cultures are also preserved. A major barrier to this successful preservation is the process of labelling a site as historical. The bureaucratic nature of designating a site as historic was labeled a top challenge by 9% of experts (Source D). Additionally, the requirements for a building to be deemed historically significant are not widely agreed upon, making it difficult to determine whether or not a building qualifies for preservation or not (Source B). This causes many buildings that could potentially be historic to not become preserved, resulting in their demolition. The concept of historical preservation is a valuable idea, but there have been issues effectively putting it into practice. If the process for establishing sites as historically significant was improved, historic preservation would be a major success, with many positive impacts. Change can be beneficial, but it is just as important to preserve reminders of the past.",

        "sourceA": "\\\"National Historic Preservation Act.\\\" *National Park Service*, U.S. Department of the Interior, 2 Dec. 2018, nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservation/national-historic-preservation-act.htm. The following is excerpted from a Web site maintained by the United States National Park Service. After World War II, the United States seemed poised at the edge of a limitless future, and its vision of progress was characterized by the sleek and the new. Urban renewal was seen as a way to clear out the slums, get rid of \\\"obsolete\\\" buildings, make space for an exploding population, and accommodate the burgeoning car culture. Wide swaths were demolished: entire blocks, neighborhoods, business districts, all razed to make way for the new. By the 1960s, urban renewal had altered the face of the nation’s cities. But out of this wholesale erasure of the old grew the most important law governing how we treat those places that define our past: the National Historic Preservation Act. It was the first national policy governing preservation and it would shape the fate of many of our historic and cultural sites over the next half-century. There had been earlier measures to foster preservation—the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Historic Sites Act of 1935—but none were as sweeping or as influential as the National Historic Preservation Act. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson convened a special committee on historic preservation. The committee studied the dismal situation, then delivered a report to Congress. Their report, called *With Heritage So Rich*, became a rallying cry for the preservation movement. Up until that time, the National Park Service’s Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) had documented 12,000 places in the United States. By 1966, half of them had either been destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Before the year was out, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act. It was the most comprehensive preservation law the nation had ever known. The act established permanent institutions and created a clearly defined process for historic preservation in the United States. Historic structures that would be affected by federal projects—or by work that was federally funded—now had to be documented to standards issued by the Secretary of the Interior. The law required individual states to take on much more responsibility for historic sites in their jurisdictions. Each state would now have its own historic preservation office and was required to complete an inventory of important sites. The law also created the President’s Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the National Register of Historic Places, an official list not only of individual buildings and structures, but also of districts, objects, and archeological sites that are important due to their connection with the past. With the passage of the act, preservation in the United States became formalized and professionalized. The National Historic Preservation Act was tied to a growing awareness of the past and of community identity. Many communities realized that there was an unexpected economic force behind preservation. The act helped foster heritage tourism, attracting visitors who wanted to experience the past in ways that no book or documentary could match. The distinctive character of old architecture and historic districts became a powerful draw for many Americans, and antidote to anonymous suburbs and strip malls.",
        "sourceB": "Merlino, Kathryn Rogers. *Building Reuse: Sustainability, Preservation, and the Value of Design.* University of Washington Press, 2018. The following is excerpted from a book advocating for more reuse of existing buildings. In the United States, the recognition of value in buildings began with the identification and preservation of historical structures that had played an important part of the story of creating our nation. Historic designation usually takes into consideration national standards of significance set within specific boundaries: to be designated, a building must be proven to be associated with an important moment in local or national history, or with a historical individual or group, or must represent an exceptional architectural style or tradition. Of course, the question of what should be considered \\\"significant\\\" historical and cultural value in a building is often hotly debated by owners, historians, politicians, community groups, and other interested parties. When the terms of significance can’t be established or agreed upon, it becomes practically impossible to \\\"officially\\\" declare something historic—and suddenly, the building lacks \\\"value.\\\" For this reason, basing preservation decisions solely on whether a building has been designated as \\\"historic\\\" significantly limits the way we value and preserve existing buildings. In effect, the word historic saves them, but old or existing does not, and anyone who wants to demolish a building can simply argue that the building lacks historical significance. Considering that \\\"nonhistoric\\\" buildings comprise the vast majority of our existing building stock, we need to broaden our definition of value if we are to maintain cultural and environmental sustainability. Attaching value to buildings exclusively for their architectural, cultural, or historic significance is problematic in three ways. First, only buildings with the highest historic status are considered valuable enough to be protected from demolition, but this type of building represents only a small percentage of designated buildings. As a result, the majority of historic designations are primarily honorific; and while they provide financial incentives for maintaining a building’s character and may give it greater stature and recognition, they do not protect it from demolition. Second, the historic designation process is piecemeal and irregular—and therefore complicated, time-consuming, and discouraging. The result is that only a small fraction of eligible buildings are even nominated, and those that win registry constitute a tiny portion of the buildings that—by the same standards—would qualify. Finally, attaching value to buildings exclusively because of their notarized historical significance ignores the fact that all buildings inherently hold value as environmental artifacts. They are repositories of extracted and manufactured materials and represent expended energy and carbon emissions; and as such, they hold great value as environmental resources. Consequently, while we rigorously recycle our paper, glass, and metal, we do not apply this ethic to our largest manufactured artifacts, our buildings. Regarding our existing building stock as an environmental resource is essential to advancing any agenda of sustainability. The opportunities that older buildings offer are enormous. Older buildings not only have worth as resources or materials but also can be retrofitted with energy-efficient technologies for high performance. In fact, some older buildings already have a head start. Studies show that many older buildings already perform as well as or better than new buildings by many measures.",

It's not historic in the sense that anything especially important happened here—certainly not in the modest rowhouses that make up the bulk of the neighborhood. What \"historic\" means, here and in cities across the country, is that this is a neighborhood where buildings are not supposed to change.\n\nThe law says window frames on Capitol Hill must be wooden, or something that looks very much like wood. If a front door has two parts and opens down the middle, it cannot be replaced by a single door that swings open from the side. If the house was built two stories tall, it must remain two stories tall—unless the addition can't be seen from the street.\n\nHumans don't like change, so it's not surprising that historic preservation laws have become quite popular. There are now more than 2,300 local historic districts across the United States, and I know many people who would like to have their own neighborhood frozen in time.\n\nBut historic preservation comes at a cost: It obstructs change for the better.

        "sourceF": "Chatterton, Paul. *Unlocking Sustainable Cities: A Manifesto for Real Change.* Pluto Press, 2019. The following is an excerpt from a book exploring the benefits of urban rewilding. We are beginning to see a proliferation of hybrid natural and built forms through, for example, living walls, rooftop farms, vertical or sky gardens and breathing buildings. These can have significant beneficial effects. For example, urban street canyons refer to the effect created by high buildings lining a street, which can become hotspots for harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. A study by Thomas Pugh and colleagues from the Lancaster Environment Centre suggests that strategic placement of vegetation in street canyons can cut air pollution by up to 30 per cent. They can also stop urban overheating and provide effective insulation and shading for buildings, as well as reducing noise pollution. And of course, there are the psychological and aesthetic benefits of being proximate to an abundance of natural greenery. Green corridors and linear parks can be retrofitted into the existing city. For example, the High Line project in New York transformed an old rail line into a nearly two-mile urban park. It opened in 2014 and became a short cut for walkers and one of the city’s favourite parks featuring art installations and places for hanging out. Other cities are following suit including Chicago’s 606 Park and Toronto’s Bentway, which has slotted 55 outdoor rooms under its Gardiner Expressway featuring farmers’ markets, performance spaces and a children’s garden. Miami is also building the Underline, a nine-mile linear park underneath its metrorail line. In my own city of Leeds, a community group is attempting to do the same thing on one of Leeds’ abandoned Victorian train viaducts. The Madrid Rio project was one of the most exciting urban reclamation projects in Europe—burying a former ring road to create over 600 hectares of parkland. Efforts are being made not just to create greenspaces, but to create interconnected green corridors. For example, the All London Green Grid (ALGG) is the green infrastructure strategy for London, which sets out a vision to create an interconnected network of green and blue spaces across the entire city. It is this interconnection that is so important in terms of creating space for biodiversity to move more extensively. Singapore is one of the pioneers of placing nature at the heart of its planning and urban design process. As a self-labelled garden city, it now prefers to call itself \\\"the city in a garden.\\\" To realize this vision of living in an urban park, Singapore implemented a landscape replacement policy whereby any greenery removed during construction has to be reinstated as part of the development. It is estimated that the amount of urban greenery has been at least doubled, but mainly through sky gardens. The city has also built nearly 300km of park connectors to create deeper connections between parks and neighbourhoods.",
        "essay": "There is no doubt that humans have had the capability to change the future through important historic events in the past. The Civil rights movement, or the women's rights movements are examples of historical events that reshaped the American people know today. In order to share these events, and allow history to be remembered, there are museums and buildings that hold meaning, and these buildings are able to stay up thanks to the Historical Preservation law. This law allowed Historical relevent places to be a perminant institution, meaning they couldn't be knocked down or replaced. However, although keeping the past allows for the people to learn from past mistakes and hopefully stop repetition in history. Ultimentaly, the Historical Preservation law should be empad but stopped because change is apart of moving on to a better future, and because space is valuable for the generation of the present, and not past. Historical Preservation makes buildings lawfully protected from being destroyed or taken down if it is historically valuable and important. However according to Appelbaum Binyamin, writter of 'when Historical Preservation Hurts Cities', Binyamin explains that Historical preservations makes it so that, 'buildings (in neighborhoods) are not suppose to change' (Source C). The preservation not doesn't preserve the past, but it also stops the neighborhood in the past because by keeping a historical building, it only gives reminders of the past, making change to be almost impossi ble not only would there be time for newer buildings, but because the buildings draws the attention away from whats becoming wanted. Binyamin also clearly states that, 'Humans don't like change' (Source C) which is only further proven by the preservation of old buildings that mean nothing to today's world because the history was already made. This leads to the second reasoning. Not only does preservation become an obstacle from making a change, but also because the space that preservations are taking up, can be used to build things more useful for the people in the present. Preservation's top 1 problem according to Webb and Amy, is and 'needs for funding' (Source D). About 24% of people agreed to needs for funding while in second place about 21% of people say relevence was the problem for Historical Preservations. Many if not problems shown that, Historical preservations is more forcable maintaining themselves because they aren't having enough funding. The owners of the buildings are strugling to decide if, People aren't interested in an old building then they won't spend money to sec or preserve it. With that, the space preservations are taking up can be replaced for homeless sheleters to not only make it relevant to the problems of today, but also keep the people of the present rather than the buildings of the past. According to Merlino, Kathryn Rogers Historical Reservation tried to save this problem, by only keeping Historical building that have 'value in order to maintain cultural and environmental sustainability' (Source B). However the problem with this is that most of historically valued things are kept in one building when they should be kept in combination with other artifacts. By maintaining the artifacts in one building won't be wasted and history can still be maintained. In conclusion Historical preservation laws are only limiting change and are more focus on maintaining the past rather than fix the present, which is why history should be stopped.",

Regarding our existing building stock as an environmental resource is essential to advancing any agenda of sustainability. The opportunities that older buildings offer are enormous. Older buildings not only have worth as resources or materials but also can be retrofitted with energy-efficient technologies for high performance. In fact, some older buildings already have a head start. Studies show that many older buildings already perform as well as or better than new buildings by many measures.",

It's not historic in the sense that anything especially important happened here—certainly not in the modest rowhouses that make up the bulk of the neighborhood. What \"historic\" means, here and in cities across the country, is that this is a neighborhood where buildings are not supposed to change.\n\nThe law says window frames on Capitol Hill must be wooden, or something that looks very much like wood. If a front door has two parts and opens down the middle, it cannot be replaced by a single door that swings open from the side. If the house was built two stories tall, it must remain two stories tall—unless the addition can't be seen from the street.\n\nHumans don't like change, so it's not surprising that historic preservation laws have become quite popular. There are now more than 2,300 local historic districts across the United States, and I know many people who would like to have their own neighborhood frozen in time.\n\nBut historic preservation comes at a cost: It obstructs change for the better. And while that price is generally invisible, it is now on public display because of the city's efforts to prevent Washington homeowners in historic neighborhoods from installing visible rooftop solar panels . . .\n\n\"I applaud your greenness, and your desire to save the planet . . .\" Chris Landis, an architect who sat on one of the boards that pass judgment on proposed changes to Washington homes, told a homeowner in October who had the temerity to request permission to install 12 front-facing solar panels on his own roof. \"But I just have this vision of a row of houses with solar panels on the front of them and it just—it upsets me, as somebody who's supposed to protect the architectural fabric of a neighborhood.\"",

        "sourceF": "Chatterton, Paul. *Unlocking Sustainable Cities: A Manifesto for Real Change.* Pluto Press, 2019. The following is an excerpt from a book exploring the benefits of urban rewilding. We are beginning to see a proliferation of hybrid natural and built forms through, for example, living walls, rooftop farms, vertical or sky gardens and breathing buildings. These can have significant beneficial effects. For example, urban street canyons refer to the effect created by high buildings lining a street, which can become hotspots for harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. A study by Thomas Pugh and colleagues from the Lancaster Environment Centre suggests that strategic placement of vegetation in street canyons can cut air pollution by up to 30 per cent. They can also stop urban overheating and provide effective insulation and shading for buildings, as well as reducing noise pollution. And of course, there are the psychological and aesthetic benefits of being proximate to an abundance of natural greenery. Green corridors and linear parks can be retrofitted into the existing city. For example, the High Line project in New York transformed an old rail line into a nearly two-mile urban park. It opened in 2014 and became a short cut for walkers and one of the city’s favourite parks featuring art installations and places for hanging out. Other cities are following suit including Chicago’s 606 Park and Toronto’s Bentway, which has slotted 55 outdoor rooms under its Gardiner Expressway featuring farmers’ markets, performance spaces and a children’s garden. Miami is also building the Underline, a nine-mile linear park underneath its metrorail line. In my own city of Leeds, a community group is attempting to do the same thing on one of Leeds’ abandoned Victorian train viaducts. The Madrid Rio project was one of the most exciting urban reclamation projects in Europe—burying a former ring road to create over 600 hectares of parkland. Efforts are being made not just to create greenspaces, but to create interconnected green corridors. For example, the All London Green Grid (ALGG) is the green infrastructure strategy for London, which sets out a vision to create an interconnected network of green and blue spaces across the entire city. It is this interconnection that is so important in terms of creating space for biodiversity to move more extensively. Singapore is one of the pioneers of placing nature at the heart of its planning and urban design process. As a self-labelled garden city, it now prefers to call itself \\\"the city in a garden.\\\" To realize this vision of living in an urban park, Singapore implemented a landscape replacement policy whereby any greenery removed during construction has to be reinstated as part of the development. It is estimated that the amount of urban greenery has been at least doubled, but mainly through sky gardens. The city has also built nearly 300km of park connectors to create deeper connections between parks and neighbourhoods.",
        "essay": "Due to the ever and always changing society that is the world of today, the value of laws that are put into place to preserve buildings of historic importance, is relatively high as change is a necessity. The value of preservation laws for historic buildings is high due to the amount of challenges that come with preservation. Source D shows the issues associated with preservation. It explains, through survey results, that the issues range from a lack of funding to pressures from new developments to lack of diversity and education. Because of these challenges that are present when going through the process of preservation for buildings that are of historic value, putting laws into place that support that should be of high value and importance. The value of preservation laws for historic buildings is high because of the amount of disparity when it comes to deeming things historic. Having precise laws that are clear on about the standards and specifications needed to be considered historic is important and would make them of high value. Source B explains the difficulty of considering/deeming things historic. It explains some of the standards, such as associated history or location, that go into deciding whether or not a building is historic (Merlino). Having specific laws that clearly describe the specifications and standards are of high value. This is because it’s a problem, and need for these laws are of high value and the problem requires immediate response. Source F shows the type of objects that could get deemed historic should specific laws not be put into place. Source F shows a man sitting in a chair that has no immediately recognizable important features or conditions or importance that would qualify it to be deemed historic, yet, he is petitioning for it to be saved regardless (Rosen). The historification of objects just because we like them is not the reason historic preservation happens. This is why there is high value in laws that are in place for preservation.",

The following is excerpted from a newspaper article about food truck regulation in Baltimore. The turf battle brewing in Baltimore involving the city’s food trucks is one that is playing out across the country as mobile vendors fight to park where they want, when they want. Food truck owners Nikki McGowan and Joey Vanoni teamed up this month with a national legal advocacy group to sue the city of Baltimore, contending that a rule that prohibits mobile vendors from operating within 300 feet of businesses that sell similar products is an unconstitutional, protectionist measure. Parking restrictions on food trucks have affected entrepreneurs as close as Baltimore County and as far away as San Antonio, where a law similar to Baltimore’s buffer rule was repealed last year after a challenge from the same group at work in the Baltimore case, the Institute for Justice. Closer to home, Baltimore County doesn’t allow food trucks to park within 200 feet of restaurants. And the Annapolis city council is considering a bill that would expand the areas where food trucks can park but prohibit them from setting up within 100 feet of an established restaurant. \\\"From a national level, you’re seeing a major amount of push-back toward inefficient and inconsistent issues that are holding back this industry from growing as fast as it could,\\\" said Andrew Alvarez, an industry analyst with the international market research firm IBISWorld. Baltimore’s buffer law was enacted as part of a swath of measures to regulate the burgeoning local food truck industry. And some restaurant owners support the rule that prohibits food trucks from pulling up in front of their businesses. Brian McComas, president of the Federal Hill Hospitality Association and owner of Ryleigh’s Oyster, said it’s not about the competition. \\\"I actually support food trucks from the perspective of the culinary experience and the food scene of Baltimore City,\\\" he said. Rather, he said, it comes down to the commitment that brick-and-mortar restaurants make to the neighborhoods in which they are rooted, and the price they pay to do business there. \\\"I don’t see anything constitutional about parking your food truck or mobile restaurant within those distances of restaurants that are there 365 days a year, paying taxes, utilities, et cetera,\\\" he said. \\\"We’ve decided to be there every day of the year. We pay taxes, and unless they can tell us otherwise how that would work, why would we even want them taking a parking space?\\\" That’s especially true in areas like Federal Hill, where bars and restaurants are concentrated and parking comes at a premium. Matt Geller, founder of the National Food Truck Association, said much of the controversy surrounding food truck regulation stems from the fact that the industry is relatively young. The U.S. food truck industry is worth $857 million, according to a September 2015 report by IBISWorld, with annual growth of 9.3 percent. \\\"This is such a new industry, so people have these weird things they believe to be fair or unfair,\\\" said Geller, who is also CEO of the Southern California Mobile Food Vendors Association. \\\"People don’t know how to regulate it yet.\\\"",

The following is excerpted from a book on how to start a food truck business. The Future of Food Trucks. Food trucks are far from hitting their peak. The market is still developing, and there are many opportunities for new operators who want to open trucks to sell food that they are passionate about. Technomic, a food industry consulting firm, reported in July 2011 that 91 percent of customers polled believe that food trucks are not a passing fad, but rather a trend with \\\"staying power.\\\" Growth in food trucks is driven by two major forces: the growth of a mobile food culture in new municipalities across the United States and the improved access to food that the trucks offer in these markets as well as established markets. Customers appreciate the value and quality of mobile food and will continue to embrace the industry so long as operators deliver clean, tasty, and interesting products at a fair price. Food trucks are great for cities. They get customers out on the street and create a sense of community. As local municipalities learn the value of what food trucks have to offer in terms of tax revenues, job growth, tourism, activating public space, and fostering entrepreneurship, local regulations will improve. One of the most compelling aspects of food trucks is their ability to act as an incubator for entrepreneurs to start a viable, cash flow–positive business that they can grow into a brick-and-mortar establishment to become a more stable part of the community. In addition to opportunities for food truck entrepreneurs, there is also a wide variety of opportunities in supporting industries that will develop as the food truck market matures. Food truck operators are looking for better trucks, more eco-friendly power supplies, quieter generators, small-run food manufacturers, more customizable insurance resources, more robust financing tools, marketing partners, and information technology resources. It is an exciting time for mobile food in America. The industry is big and growing fast. I look forward to seeing what you will contribute to it.",
        "essay": "Many sit-in restaurants, especially family-owned restaurants, have put tremendous work, money, and time into building a scenic, tasty, and successful restaurant. However, as the mobile food industry begins to evolve, it is extremely important that cities implement certain regulations on food trucks. Some of these restrictions may include the proximity to other restaurants, or the extent to which the features on food trucks can be manipulated outside of a standard truck in order to ensure that traditional restaurants are not being dominated and pushed out of business. First and foremost, cities should absolutely consider implementing a restriction on how close food trucks can station themselves to a restaurant. For instance, Source D highlights the issue of food trucks parking right outside of restaurants that are 'there 365 days a year, paying taxes, utilities, et cetera' (Source D). For clarification, what is being enunciated here is that restaurants are always stationed on their property 24/7 year-round, and have to pay various bills in order to maintain function and cleanliness of their buildings. So, it is rather unreasonable that food trucks would station themselves in food service territory that is very much not their place to intrude in. Unfortunately, however, it is emphasized in the food truck regulation guide of New Orleans that there is 'no proximity restriction from restaurants for food trucks' (Source B). If such restrictions are not placed in New Orleans, it is almost certain that such rules are absent in other cities where mobile food trucks are becoming increasingly popular. As a result of this lack of regulation, however, sit-in restaurants may become jeopardized and overruled by food trucks if restaurant-proximity rules are not put into place for food trucks. Hence, it is direly important that cities consider implementing a rule for how close a food truck can park to a restaurant when regulating mobile food service establishments. In addition to parking on, or near, restaurant property, it is critical that certain rules are developed in order to prevent food trucks from evolving outside of their traditional structure and furnishing, thus further protecting sitdown food establishments from being outcompeted. In order to illustrate this worry, Source E shows a food truck decked out with tables and furniture, as well as the traditional grab-and-go style of food trucks. What this image of food truck design is meant to convey is the idea that as latter established trucks develop and become more popularized, they will take advantage of the extent to which they can morph themselves into a literal moving restaurant. This issue is emphasized in a New York Times magazine, claiming that mobile food truck owners are 'building mini empires' (Source A). On the other hand, food trucks started off and are traditionally known to be rather simple, and it is crucial that such simplicity stays in order to keep restaurants from dealing with unfair competition that has mutated too far outside of tradition. The only way to be sure that food trucks will not evolve into walking restaurants that reach their respective peak is to make it key for cities to place regulations on the food trucks such as restricting furniture and dining options. Since food trucks have only recently become popular in cities, it is all the more important that rules and restrictions are put in place by cities as soon as possible in order to prevent any unfair conditions for restaurants that have been established much longer than mobile food services. Even just a few policies such as the proximity that a food truck is allowed to park from a restaurant and the restriction of features that do not maintain distinguishability from a sit-in restaurant are vital implementations in order to sustain normalcy within city food industries.",

The following is excerpted from a newspaper article about food truck regulation in Baltimore. The turf battle brewing in Baltimore involving the city’s food trucks is one that is playing out across the country as mobile vendors fight to park where they want, when they want. Food truck owners Nikki McGowan and Joey Vanoni teamed up this month with a national legal advocacy group to sue the city of Baltimore, contending that a rule that prohibits mobile vendors from operating within 300 feet of businesses that sell similar products is an unconstitutional, protectionist measure. Parking restrictions on food trucks have affected entrepreneurs as close as Baltimore County and as far away as San Antonio, where a law similar to Baltimore’s buffer rule was repealed last year after a challenge from the same group at work in the Baltimore case, the Institute for Justice. Closer to home, Baltimore County doesn’t allow food trucks to park within 200 feet of restaurants. And the Annapolis city council is considering a bill that would expand the areas where food trucks can park but prohibit them from setting up within 100 feet of an established restaurant. \\\"From a national level, you’re seeing a major amount of push-back toward inefficient and inconsistent issues that are holding back this industry from growing as fast as it could,\\\" said Andrew Alvarez, an industry analyst with the international market research firm IBISWorld. Baltimore’s buffer law was enacted as part of a swath of measures to regulate the burgeoning local food truck industry. And some restaurant owners support the rule that prohibits food trucks from pulling up in front of their businesses. Brian McComas, president of the Federal Hill Hospitality Association and owner of Ryleigh’s Oyster, said it’s not about the competition. \\\"I actually support food trucks from the perspective of the culinary experience and the food scene of Baltimore City,\\\" he said. Rather, he said, it comes down to the commitment that brick-and-mortar restaurants make to the neighborhoods in which they are rooted, and the price they pay to do business there. \\\"I don’t see anything constitutional about parking your food truck or mobile restaurant within those distances of restaurants that are there 365 days a year, paying taxes, utilities, et cetera,\\\" he said. \\\"We’ve decided to be there every day of the year. We pay taxes, and unless they can tell us otherwise how that would work, why would we even want them taking a parking space?\\\" That’s especially true in areas like Federal Hill, where bars and restaurants are concentrated and parking comes at a premium. Matt Geller, founder of the National Food Truck Association, said much of the controversy surrounding food truck regulation stems from the fact that the industry is relatively young. The U.S. food truck industry is worth $857 million, according to a September 2015 report by IBISWorld, with annual growth of 9.3 percent. \\\"This is such a new industry, so people have these weird things they believe to be fair or unfair,\\\" said Geller, who is also CEO of the Southern California Mobile Food Vendors Association. \\\"People don’t know how to regulate it yet.\\\"",

        "essay": "From fast food, to ice cream trucks and delivery services, the trend of convenient food has been on the rise in the past few decades. Yet, one major innovation has oft been overlooked. Food trucks are a valuable addition to the dining industry in many places, providing aspiring restaurant owners a realistic avenue for development. However, when regulating this industry, cities should consider how to keep them from impeding on existing establishments and laws as well as the value they provide in the particular city. To keep competition fair and laws in place, the food truck industry should be regulated with already existing practices in place. A major point of contention for food trucks is their interference with the operation of pre-existing restaurants. Baltimore currently requires all food trucks operating within its city to be more than 300 feet away from any competing business (Document D). Yet, this seems fairly extreme. Competition with similar markets has existed since capitalism was invented and wouldn’t be the same without it. I do see the point however, a mobile business sapping one’s customers isn’t pleasant, but it’s an essential part of capitalism. This competition shouldn’t violate existing laws though. In New Orleans, food trucks are allowed to operate within any proximity to existing businesses as long as they respect existing laws including parking meters (Document B). Opposed to Baltimore, New Orleans has adopted a more classic, capitalist approach to food trucks. As long as they don’t break the law, competition with existing businesses by food trucks is fair. The regulation in New Orleans fosters much more of the growth in industry by competition than that in Baltimore, creating a diverse food industry in the area. When regulating food trucks, it’s important to note how they bring value to a city. Food trucks, by nature, bring a diversity to pre-existing food industries. These mobile restaurants often promote community with outdoor seating, resulting in a widespread community, according to Document F. The community strengthened by the presence of food trucks certainly does exist, yet the document misses an important point. Growth of community only happens in this respect because of the nature of the trucks, bringing a mobile approach to a static local food industry. Not to say that static is bad per se, but the competition these trucks bring allow one’s local area to respond in kind, innovating. Development of this kind only happens when competition is abound, and with strict regulation like that in Baltimore, competition is much more of a static and slow process. With this rise in food trucks in the past few decades, many things need to be thought of in the process of regulating the business. Regulation shouldn’t impede on a food truck’s operation, nor stifle potential for innovation through competition, but existing laws should be followed. Regulation should allow the growth of one’s city, not impede it.",

        "question": "Mobile food service establishments, such as food trucks and food carts, have become increasingly trendy in recent years, offering customers appealing and often innovative dining options out of vehicles that can easily be located near workplaces and leisure activities. These businesses have sometimes been held back from expanding because of local regulations that restrict their activities and require operators to obtain licenses and certifications. Proponents of these regulations say that laws are needed to ensure that the meals offered by mobile food services are safe and that these businesses do not have an unfair advantage over traditional restaurants. Carefully read the following six sources, including the introductory information for each source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on what are the most important factors for cities to consider when regulating mobile food service establishments. Source A (Baker article), Source B (New Orleans permit guide), Source C (U.S. Census Bureau graph), Source D (Meehan article), Source E (Neseman cartoon), Source F (Weber book). In your response you should do the following: Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position. Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly the sources used through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses. Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.

But in pioneering cities like Austin, Tex., and Portland, Ore., the industry is feeling growing pains as fickle customers move on and regulators clamp down.\n\nSo entrepreneurs are finding new locations to park their mobile restaurants.\n\nLast October, a development team created a new dining concept in an up-and-coming neighborhood of Charleston, S.C. Called the Container Bar, it features a bar constructed from a shipping container with space for four food trucks that rotate daily.\n\n\"Charleston has a reputation of being a culinary mecca, but it is unique in that there are no spaces for food trucks to congregate,\" said Brad Creger, one of three Container Bar owners. The others are Mike Veeck, president of the Charleston RiverDogs, a minor league baseball team, and the actor Bill Murray.\n\n\"One need go no further than Austin or Portland to see how food trucks have evolved into the culinary culture,\" Mr. Creger said. \"Charleston is a little behind in that regard, but we're catching up very quickly.\"\n\nPortland may be the aspirational model for many cities in the early stages of building a food cart$^1$ scene. But being a pioneer has its own challenges. A surge in new construction over the past couple of years has forced the closing of several food cart pods on former parking lots. Concern about the closings came to a head last fall with the news that the city's flagship food cart venue, the Alder Street pod, would be shuttered this summer to make way for the city's first five-star hotel.\n\n\"One hundred and thirty food carts are under threat to vanish,\" said Daniel Huerta, owner of the Portland food truck Churros Locos. \"We are losing the culinary fabric that Portland is.\"\n\nStreet food vendors have been in big cities for decades. But a newer breed of entrepreneurs surfaced around 10 years ago as a snappy response to the recession — it is far easier to secure start-up capital for a cart than a restaurant. Since then, it has morphed into a nationwide urban development and culinary business phenomenon. Revenue from food carts reached $2.7 billion in 2017, according to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study.\n\nBut as the industry matures, challenges are emerging. In some areas, owners are building mini empires, adding second or third trucks as well as brick-and-mortar restaurants. But elsewhere, regulatory and market pressures are creating a tough operating environment for vendors. Oversaturation and changing culinary tastes are also concerns.\n\n$^1$ Food trucks and food carts are subject to similar regulations; in this article, they are referred to interchangeably.",

        "essay": "Food trucks have become a popular choice around growing cities. They’re convenient, fast, and best of all, affordable. Due to food trucks being a recently \\\"new\\\" method for fast dining, people have yet to know how to properly regulate them and end up creating many regulations that can harm the business. The regulations are set up helpful to navigate and illustrate how to open up the businesses, however, it ruins its ability to get more customers and harder to keep the food truck business open. Some factors can contribute to helping, but others do not. Food trucks are the recently new thing thats been popular amongst the people, so creating the new regulations could be a difficult task. The most important ones should be keeping the truck clean and sterile. Especially in large cities, many food trucks can forget to clean the area, making it unsafe the eat the food without people knowing. These types of regulations are normal and expected. However theres also dramatic laws made that upset many of the food truck workers. For example, the extreme parking regulations they have to follow such as, not being allowed to park YOUR truck next to a restaurant, even when youre paying all the taxes and fees. According to document D, it states, \\\"And the Annapolis city council is considering a bill that would expand the areas where food trucks can park but prohibit them from setting up within 100 feet of an establish restaurant.\\\" \\\"I dont see anything constitutional about parking your food truck or mobile restaurant within those distances of restaurants that are there 365 days a year, paying taxes, utilities, et cetera.\\\" The parking regulations are seen to be un fair as they are paying for that truck and dont feel like its fair to not place a food truck near restaurants, especially in big cities, where restaurants are placed all over. Other parking regulations that are important to consider is that the truck isnt allowed to remain in an area for over 4 hours, they need to obey all traffic laws, and have other limitations as where they cant park. These factors are important to recognize because its making food truck drivers stress over where to place their business and paying eve more fees on top of what they pay. According to the regulations on document B it writes \\\"Vendors must obey all applicable parking, traffic and vehicle safety laws, regulations, and restrictions. This includes feeding of parking meters. Mobile food trucks may not operate: within 20 feet of any intersection, within 20 feet of any stop sign..., within 3 feet of any public or private driveway....\\\" These factors contribute to many food trucks needing to shut down because this causes their business to not be affordable. Other factors to consider when regulating food truck establishments are the terms to be able to operate. These can definitely cause major headaches on the business owner. In document B the bullet points show how some of these regulations are limiting how many food trucks can open a year, the need for a completed application before allowing to open, closer rejected renewal dates, in order to either sell other things besides food, and more. Food truck operators are tired of this and end up closing. These regulations are important for the citizens that too love food trucks and dont want them to close either. In document C, it shows a chart representing the growth in food trucks from 2013–2018, symbolizing the citizens growth in love for them as well. They can support the small business owners and help make the change. Overall, these factors stated are the most important factors that can contribute to food trucks growth in business. The regulations systems are new so its not unexpected that many rules were put up in order to offer safety concerns. However, it is finally time to realize that the food truck owners have created a great way of getting food and shows how all these regulations are highly unnecessary and should consider newer/ more updated regulations.",
