Primary 6 student's oral reading performance.

reading of the following passage:

---
PASSAGE:
{passage}
---

Evaluate the student's performance based on the following three criteria, 
each scored from 1 to 5 (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent). For each criterion, provide:

- A **numeric rating** (1–5).
- **Specific feedback** (1–2 sentences) highlighting exact words or phrases where the student excelled or needs improvement.
- **Actionable suggestions** for improvement, focusing on precise aspects such as mispronounced words, areas lacking expression, or issues with pacing.

**Evaluation Criteria and Scoring Examples:**

1. **Fluency** (smoothness of reading, appropriate pace, natural flow)

   - **5 (Excellent):** Reads smoothly with appropriate pacing and natural pauses. *Example:* "She walked hurriedly to the supermarket..." delivered with a quickened pace reflecting urgency.
   - **4 (Good):** Generally fluent with minor hesitations. *Example:* Slight pause before "supermarket" but maintains overall flow.
   - **3 (Satisfactory):** Noticeable hesitations and uneven pacing. *Example:* Frequent pauses mid-sentence disrupt the natural rhythm.
   - **2 (Needs Improvement):** Frequent hesitations and unnatural pacing. *Example:* Long pauses at commas and full stops, affecting comprehension.
   - **1 (Poor):** Disjointed reading with excessive pauses. *Example:* Struggles to read complete sentences without stopping.

2. **Expression** (tone variations, emphasis on important words, conveying meaning through voice)

   - **5 (Excellent):** Uses varied tone and emphasis to convey emotions effectively. *Example:* "She gasped in shock..." read with a rising intonation on "gasped" to express surprise.
   - **4 (Good):** Appropriate expression with minor inconsistencies. *Example:* Emphasizes key words but occasionally uses a flat tone.
   - **3 (Satisfactory):** Limited variation in tone; some expression present. *Example:* Monotone delivery with occasional emphasis on obvious words.
   - **2 (Needs Improvement):** Minimal expression; lacks emotional conveyance. *Example:* Reads dialogue without changing tone to reflect character emotions.
   - **1 (Poor):** Monotonous reading with no expression. *Example:* Entire passage read in a flat tone, regardless of content.

3. **Pronunciation** (correct pronunciation of words, clarity of speech)

   - **5 (Excellent):** Pronounces all words clearly and accurately. *Example:* Correctly articulates "mischievous" and "chaos" without hesitation.
   - **4 (Good):** Minor mispronunciations that do not hinder understanding. *Example:* Mispronounces "yacht" as "yatch" but maintains clarity.
   - **3 (Satisfactory):** Several mispronunciations; some impact on understanding. *Example:* Misreads "develop" as "divelop," causing slight confusion.
   - **2 (Needs Improvement):** Frequent mispronunciations affecting comprehension. *Example:* Mispronounces "th" sounds, saying "fink" instead of "think."
   - **1 (Poor):** Numerous mispronunciations severely impacting understanding. *Example:* Consistently misreads common words, making the passage hard to follow.
