      "essay": "Materialism has been defined in America for a decent amount of time. Madonna herself noted how we are \"living in a material world\" and that she desires to be that \"material girl.\" Jimmy Santiago Baca asserts that we value possessions over the stories of our own lives. This is not always the case, however, as many films still continue to share the stories of many—such as The Pursuit of Happiness, which shares the story of a father attempting to get a stable income to support his son after he and his wife's divorce. It is an inspirational tale that was rather moving, yet it is still apparent how much materialism is valued. Although the stories that make us who we are are still presently shared, American society does value material possessions more, especially in the new age.\n\nFirst off, American society values materialistic possessions very presently in the age of online media. Social media influencers on TikTok and Instagram promote the usage of clothing and makeup products that reach a wide variety of audiences, including younger children. The craze of “10-year-old Sephora Girls” who are supposedly being very rude to Sephora employees and using their parents’ credit cards to buy anti-aging and other skincare products demonstrates how materialism is affecting American society in large numbers. It promotes products as being the key to a better life rather than experience or community that actually prove to make human life more enjoyable. Social media reaches a wide audience and can influence larger numbers into agreement as to why what is being promoted is the best and should be owned by you. Advertising was built on the foundations of the war-propaganda business in the 1940s and has grown from the convincing tactics used many years ago to feed into its gains in capital. Using tactics of persuasion that are still heavily used—such as peer pressure, which is a fuel for social media influencing—the idea that “everyone has that so you should too” only grows with the use of online outlets to promote those ideas. Thus, the use of social media influencers has a large effect on the promotion of materialistic value over the stories we share.\n\nSecondly, Americans value possessions more than the stories we share as a result of dissatisfaction. Some may feel that their life is not as good as others’ due to the material possessions others own. The song “Everybody’s Got Nice Stuff But Me” by The Dead Milkmen is a sarcastic take on that idea as the singer describes many luxuries that others own and that the singer also wishes to own so he can feel the satisfaction that others must be feeling when they can afford such things. It’s a common phrase that money can’t buy happiness, but as consumerism grows in the new age of the American economy, the value of possessions seems to outweigh that of other factors that contribute to a person’s value, like community and positivity. The act of consuming a good may bring a temporary moment of increased dopamine—but a moment cannot last forever and can only induce so much happiness over a shortened period of time. Another representation of how materialism flows from dissatisfaction is Jim Carrey’s career trajectory: after the success of his many comedy films, he indulged in many homes, boats, and other luxuries that he could never have dreamed of affording when he was much younger. Yet he was still never satisfied, no matter how many things he owned. He proceeded to make a documentary exploring that dissatisfaction, but it never brought about as much change as he had hoped for. Even in the moments of happiness brought about by new products and items, it still doesn’t last as long as other positive influences could. Nevertheless, materialistic possessions are still valued as a key to solving dissatisfaction with life, regardless of how it actually works.\n\nOverall, American society does value materialistic possessions over the stories we could share of ourselves, but I am highly critical of that aspect of society. Happiness is much greater and more lasting in sharing community and experience over the aspect of owning the latest craze or fad.",

      "essay": "What value should we place on possessions? Regardless of how much emphasis we should put on them, it’s evident that as Americans we put too much. In the words of Jimmy Santiago Baca, “In America we value possessions,” which feels truer today than ever.\n\nThe trends in America are one cultural aspect that supports Baca’s point. While societies throughout the history of the world have had trends, they are faster and bigger than before in America. Walk into any high school or middle school classroom in the country and you will see at least a couple girls with Stanley cups. This trend is relatively new (replacing Hydro Flasks from a few years back), but it’s guaranteed to die out a couple years from now and be replaced by something else. Is it bad to buy a trendy cup? Not at all, but it shows what we value as a society. We buy massive amounts of products that we don’t need, showing that we place more value—and status—on possessions than we should.\n\nWhat would the mental health of a country that puts too much stock in possessions look like? It would have soaring anxiety and depression rates, which is just what we’re seeing in America today. When you focus your life on something shallow and surface-level (such as the things that you own), you lack a sense of purpose and meaning in your life. Stuff can’t ever truly fulfill you; in fact, it just ends up distracting you from the things that can. By continually focusing on surface-level things, it’s harder to build deep, meaningful connections with other people. Since we’ve fallen out of the habit of doing this as a society, people are lacking the intimacy and connection that we all crave as human beings. We think that having the right car or the right house will get us the approval that we desire, but they will only ever satisfy us on a temporal level.\n\nAmerica is indisputably one of the wealthiest nations in the world. Other countries prefer our money to theirs for its stability, and we have one of the strongest economies in the world. Despite this, there are still hundreds of thousands of starving people in our country. Families across the nation struggle to put food on the table. If this doesn’t prove that we value possessions too much, what would? We value possessions to the point that we’ve forgotten about generosity. Sure, we might buy Girl Scout cookies or give to the annual school fundraiser, but large-scale giving isn’t a part of many people’s lives. This demonstrates just how attached we are to our stuff.\n\nIn conclusion, Baca’s claim that “In America we value possessions” is undeniably accurate. It can be seen in the trends that pop up, in the growing lack of meaning in people’s lives, and in the startling number of poor for such a rich country. However, these aren’t signs to give up on our nation. Instead, they are signs to rally together, to inspire each other, and to one by one shift the value away from our possessions and to one another.",

      "essay": "In modern America we have come to value possessions highly compared to experiences. This is both reflected and supported on social media, in daily conversations we have with our peers, and is reinforced by society’s standards providing us with an easily accessible amount of dopamine.\n\nOn social media, everyone would much rather post their cool new sports car compared to the candid picture of them and their friends wide-mouthed laughing. They do this because social media in America has been trending to show everyone expensive cars, houses, and rare material things that few possess. The dopamine that is received from likes on your pictures and the amount of views has become easy to receive because it is literally at the tip of your finger. We value material things (like cars, houses, and pictures) subconsciously because they provide us with easy access to dopamine.\n\nSociety has also helped continue to push this narrative that material things can provide us with easier access to dopamine based off the daily conversations we have with peers. Society has been on a trend of giving people validation when they “achieve” something that is unattainable in modern-day America, due to an economic crisis, such as a house, car, or even the latest iPhone. Your peers validate you and give you praise when you obtain these material items that have become highly priced, feeding you with the want to achieve more of these material objects. It also makes you want to praise others who obtain these material objects too.\n\nThese items have become the foundation of our lives, shifting the driving force of America. The “American Dream” that was once based on new beginnings and so-called equal opportunity has quickly become the “American Dream” of having it all. Madonna said it best, “I’m a material girl and it’s a material world.”\n\nMaterial objects have given us easy access to dopamine. In America this dopamine can come from online posts on social media and our daily conversations with peers who validate our material objects, making it easy for us to forget about “a story that happened between grandfather and me” (Jimmy Santiago Baca). Due to all of these reasons, it is easily said that Americans value possessions more than they do experiences because of the easy access to dopamine, generating a positive response in their bodies.",

I just became an adult, and nowlim faced with a plethora of decisions about college, finances and my future career. Everyday, I am reminded of the decisions I have to make and the deadilnes. I have to decide by. It gets overwhelming. When I was In the process of choosing where I wanted to go to college there were some people around me that were making decisions within weeks. They would find a college, to ur it, think about'irl for a few weeks, and then, bam, they knew. Psome people I knew did that with their career, as well. Those same people would sit with their decisions for a few months, and then the doubts would start to rod in. \"what if I made the wrong choice? The question loomed around in their minds until they shooed it away. Or for some would change the decision that they thought was perfect for them. This was not my case.

I had no doubts. Quality decisions are Important. Hmay be easy to make decisions on the spot and take Information right as it comes and base your decisions on that Information, but in my experience, waiting despite the pressure pays off. That way, you are sure of your decision and you know it wasbased on your true desire and not the a passing wish. Making decisions that are independent of popular opinion is valuable as well.

My peers had a large influence onme, and so did the media, but I remained independent and sure of my conservative views. Some people will assimilate to the views that those around them have and thatresults in a poor foundation that is easily swayed by the fluctuating opinions to of that community.

      "essay": "What will people hear? A whisper or a song? The voice of the one or the voice of the many, united? One alone can mean very little until that one voice gains the power of many. Humans are creatures that crave validation and to fit in, so will they be one alone or be one of many? Will a person be Moses or the Jews? A community of voices can hold more power than one voice alone, but one voice can be used to inspire many, as shown throughout history through civil rights protests, Hitler, and the United States. The United States did not listen to the small protests throughout the nineteenth century regarding people's rights. It wasn't until the twentieth century when the voices of many drowned out the voices of few within Washington. Posters didn't matter until held by millions. Black was bad until millions said it wasn't. And only then when more were involved than not, did Congress hear and respond. It took an entire Civil War to see the problem the first time and it took march after march, protest after protest to bring more change in the 1960s. But eventually, with the voice of millions behind the movement, the government listened and changed. The million voices said black isn't bad, something people now realize is true, and got the world to change because of it. The truth was free and more believed than not. But what became millions started as few. Friends protesting in a group of three. It wasn't until voices, figureheads of the Civil Rights movement, like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. inspired the millions, that others listened. It took those few brave voices-barely a whisper in the crowd to turn into the song of revolution. The few were inspirations, but it didn't matter until the millions followed in pursuit. It didn't matter until the million's whispers combined to a song of great strength and perseverance. That's what brought the truth forward. At first, no one feared Hitler alone. Not even when the Nazis began growing in numbers did the rest of the world turn more than a glance to Germany. It wasn't until Germany gained communistic allies, also power-hungry, that the world turned its head to notice. Hitler held power, yes, but did people fear him or what his millions of followers could do? Hitler was the sergeant who called out orders that is scary that his one whispering voice could shout so loud to be heard by all of Germany but people feared being killed or imprisoned by his army-men followers. How many were killed personally by Hitler? Versus, how many were killed by his people, his camps, and his plans? The world stayed ignorant to Hitler when he was alone. It wasn't until he had millions protecting him and his truth that people cared. And it was too late. Ignorance is a bliss. Until it leads to a world war with affects still devastating today, eighty years later. The world should've listened for when his whisper became a voice because that voice became a shouting song of pain, hate, and destruction. The United States. Key word: united. It wasn't until all 13 colonies came together to fight back against Britain's royal crown, that Britain did worry. Massachusetts and the people of Boston throwing some tea in a harbor did nothing but anger Britain. It wasn't until the colonists across the entire 13 colonies with allies in France that Britain held concern about losing its royal subjects. The truth that colonists wanted freedom and would stop at nothing to get it, wasn't realized until it slapped Britain in the face. One colony alone held no power, only united under one government did the colonists hold any power. It's why the United States is called the United States, not the fifty separate states. And the truth of strength in numbered has reigned true throughout history when allies together beat the strongest lone power. When a country divided became United once more. When people across a continent came together. That's where power to spread the truth becomes reality: in unity. Figureheads and movements can inspire millions. But alone, they lack power to spread their message globally. They needed to make their voice heard to hundreds before the hundreds' voices became millions. One alone couldn't spread their truth, unless they had the backup of many supporting and believing that same truth. It was proved that truth and change didn't occur until voices like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. inspired millions to spread their truth. It wasn't until Hitler convinced other countries and all the people of Germany, that the world heard their voices shouting their truth. And it wasn't until the colonies became one nation under God, that Britain heard their cries for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Truth is relative, but people will believe anything if enough people are shouting at them. One voice can inspire a whisper of truth, but a million voices shouting one truth will hold more power every time.",

      "essay": "In a 2016 interview, Maxine Hong Kingston stated \"I think that individual voices are not as strong as a community of voices. If we can make a community of voices, then we can speak more truths.\" Although stated very harshly, I do believe this to be true. As sad as it is, if you are not extremely wealthy or well known, it is likely that your voice will not be heard. A community of voices is stronger than one and has plentiful power to make change. One example of a community of voices speaking their truth to make change is the Civil Rights Movement. People came together from all around the United States to overturn the Jim Crow laws and give African American people the freedom and rights that they deserved. This movement was made up of protests, acts of bravery, and more by a very large group of American people. If there was only one voice being used to make these changes, they most likely would've never been made. A community of voices is certainly stronger than one. Walkouts and protests have been held to show solidarity to victims of gun violence and raise awareness about the commonality of shootings in the United States to eventually reach the goal of ending gun violence. When walkouts are held at schools, news organizations publicize them, spreading the message of all these people. We don't know what is to come, but these groups of millions of Americans are causing our voices to be heard by people in positions of power than can help us. This would not be possible with only one voice. Overall, I believe that Maxine Kingston's claim \"I think that individual voices are not as strong as a community of voices. If we can make a community of voices, then we can speak more truths\" is valid. I agree with this claim because of the historical event, the Civil rights movement, and the ongoing attempt to end gun violence.",

      "essay": "The idea of a \"community of voices\" sound as though it would work on paper but is rather imperfect when you delve into the different implications it can hold for the community and just what it means to have a. While yes it's a very nice idea that we should have something such as a community of voices where peoples opinions can be expressed as a whole, you have to take a closer look at what that really means. To have a community of voices, that would mean many people whose back-rounds can vary. With this variation comes the problem of simply bad opinions. Now I'm not not saying that people shouldn't have the ability to express their opinions at all, it's a basic human right after all. But there are, to put it simply incorrect opinions out there, ones that defy what the general mass of people would normally find it wrong. For example, their is already a place where you can find communities that have a collective voice online; this community of voices can be seen as website and company called \"Twitter\". This site actually holds power because of the sheer number people that use it to express their opinions, as well as the ability for other people to judge these opinions. There is nothing wrong with this, but a problem arises that can be seen very often in this place where people's lives are ruined from this power though number, because the mass as a whole believed it the person deserved it or were convinced into believing it. So yes people deserve to have an opinion and the ability to express it. The implications that can show themselves when people are given a communitive voice can become quite cruel. While a person may deserve being ridiculed or judged online becasue of something they said, they don't deserve having their lives ruined even with a bad opinion. So if an that can happen in a place that isn't even physically real, their could be a lot of suffering to people who are just dissagreable if their is an actual physical outlet for that kind of behavior.",

These attein It didn't work. If anything, their trying to scare me into doing the right thing\" only made me more determined. to do the opposite. Any positive changes I could have made to be safer as a child were fought against solely because I didn't like being scared into doing things. I did indeed resent my parents for trying to control me through fear, and that kept any of the good they were attempting to enact from taking root. If reasoning and explanations were given when what I perceived as completely unfair and unnecessary tat's rules were told to me, perhaps I would have been more receptive. Instead, the fear instilled in me turned toanger and resentment towards the people who tried to change my mind, hamely my parents.\n\nThe lack of haat using rear as The use of fear as a motivator was also proven to be unsuccessful in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which began at the close of World War Two. Upon discovering that the United States had nuclear weapons, the Soviets Stole the secrets of the technology and made their own in response. This thievery and creation of the most powerful weapons known to man at the Atme was driven by fear. The fear of nuclear war and massive destruction borought about a huge spike in the production of the nuclear weapons thest had incited the problem. And in addition to fear of death from nukes that most Americans experienced in this time, there was also suspicion and resentiment towards anything perceived as \"Red\" or commenist. The worry that the Soviets would kill Amerians with nuclear weapons morphed into resentment, Which was another motivating factor behind the increased humbers of nuclear warheads in America. It was not until the 1960s that a slight compromise nas reached and levels of Fear decreased, which led to even more cooperation in the 1990s, when the humber of nuclear weapons was redveed and controlled. This positive change and involvement in the issue that huclear weapons created wasn't brovoght about by fear, bat by a wish fora better future and willingness to cooperate with others in working towards th a common goal.\n\nWhile fear is often seen as an amazing motivator that drives people to peach Solutions and to allows people to be persvaded. easier and faster, this is simply hot the case. The vse of fear to persuade others rarely allows for real positive change and persvasion to occur. Most often it causes the opposite, as seen in personal experience and in global affairs, especially regarding the Cold War.",

          "essay": "The claim made by Carlos Curbelo regarding persuasion is valid to a certain extent. Even though there may be a difference in opinion, attempting to scare an individual is not an effective method and can cause further issues. Collaboration can also heavily effect work flow as well as reduce motivation of others if there is no cooperation between everyone. For example, animators often work in large teams. If one person attempts to scare or intimidate others into agreeing with their ideas, it can create a hostile work environment which can lead to less productivity and a decline in the quality of work. Similarly in the engineering field, if team members are too scared to voice their opinions or concerns, it could lead to flaws in design that could have serious consequences.",
